	* emhaplofreq.h (xmlfprintf): Define new macro to be used for
	printing out XML (or other) statements that should be returned
	back to the external SWIG wrapper, expands to pyfprintf in SWIG
	context, otherwise it defaults back to fprintf to maintain
	compatibility with command-line version.  This was done because
	the "-Dfprintf=pyfprintf" compiler directive no longer appears to
	work with GCC 4.1.2 and because overwriting standard library
	functions via preprocessor directives is deprecated.

	* emhaplofreq.c (main_proc, linkage_diseq): Use it throughout.

	* emhaplofreq.c: Change prototypes to match function calls
	exactly, e.g. replace (*)[] invalid ANSI constructs with (*)[VAR]
	constructs which is valid ANSI C and also to placate GCC 4.0.

	* emhaplofreq_wrap.i: %module _Emhaplofreq -> Emhaplofreq for
	compatibility with most recent SWIG.

	* emhaplofreq.c (linkage_diseq): Add new alloc memory structure
	called summary_d to store the 'unprimed' LD measure.  This is
	calculated by multiplying summary_dprime by dmax, which appears to
	yield the expected behavior.  Also prints this value to the XML
	stream next to where summary_dprime is printed.

2004-02-09  Alex Lancaster  <alexl AT socrates.berkeley.edu>

	* emhaplofreq_wrap.i (main_proc): Accept new integer
	max_init_cond, in function prototype.

	* emhaplofreq.c: Add extra int to prototype of main_proc.
	(main): Hardcode MAX_INIT only when invoked from command-line (to
	preserve existing behavior).
	(main_proc): Accept new function parameter: max_init_cond, so that
	wrappers can use alternative number of initial conditions.  Don't
	assign this value from the hardcoded value in the header file.

2003-12-17  Alex Lancaster  <alexl AT socrates.berkeley.edu>

	* emhaplofreq_wrap.i (main_proc): Add matching parameter in
	prototype for SWIG wrapper.

	* emhaplofreq.c (main_proc): Add a new parameter 'permu_print', if
	set to 1 the likelihood statistic will printed to the
	output (either the permu file or the XML output depending on
	compile-time option).  Used to suppress lengthy permutation
	information when not required.
	(main): When calling from command-line, enable permu_print.
	(emcalc): Initialize 'prev_loglike' to 0.0, to
	quit compiler warning.

2003-12-12  Alex Lancaster  <alexl AT socrates.berkeley.edu>

	* emhaplofreq_wrap.i (main_proc): Update wrapper to reflect new
	function syntax.

	* emhaplofreq.c (main_proc): Add new parameters: max_permu and
	max_init_for_permu which are no longer hard-coded and can be
	passed in from an outside invocation of this function.  Use them
	in calloc()ing the 'like_ratio' and 'error_flag_permu' arrays.
	MAX_PERMU -> max_permu and MAX_INIT_FOR_PERMU ->
	max_init_for_permu throughout.
	(main): Pass the hard-coded MAX_PERMU and MAX_INIT_FOR_PERMU from
	emhaplofreq, when invoked in command-line mode, until we add
	getopt-parsed options for them.

	* Start ChangeLog.
