Third-party modules:
===================

 slatkin-exact/monte-carlo.c:

  Montgomery Slatkin's implementation of a Monte Carlo approximation
  of the Ewens-Watterson exact test of neutrality.  Original code can
  be found at:
  
   http://ib.berkeley.edu/labs/slatkin/monty/Ewens_exact.program
 
 pval:

  The code in the 'pval' directory (with the exception of 'pval.c' the
  SWIG wrapper, 'pval_wrap.i' and the Makefile) is part of the R
  project's 'nmath' numerical library (http://www.r-project.org/) and
  is also licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  Minor
  modifications have been made to allow the module to build correctly.

Obsolete modules (not distributed)

 gthwe:

  Guo and Thompson's implementation of Hardy-Weinberg exact test,
  originally coded by S.W. Guo and modified by John Chen.
