	* Makefile (DFLAGS): Add call to link ElectricFence library.
	(monte-carlo_distribution): DFLAGS -> CFLAGS.

	* monte-carlo.c (free_vector, free_ivector): New functions, to fix
	memory leak.  Before calling free() we need to shift pointer back
	to beginning to the originally malloc()'ed memory address for both
	the double vector and the integer vector because original program
	returned an pointer with an offset, and free() requires the
	pointer to match the malloc() call..
	(main_proc): Use them.  Add free_ivector for r_random variable,
	there was no free() call for this variable at all previously.
	(NR_END): Move #define to beginning of file.

	* Start ChangeLog.
