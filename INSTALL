**PyPop INSTALL file**
 
**For the impatient**

To build and install Python, type:
python setup.py build
python setup.py install


**System Requirements**


o "Python 2.1":http://www.python.org/ or later

o "Numerical Python 20.2.1 or later":http://numpy.sourceforge.net/

o "Simple Wrapper Interface Generator (SWIG)":http://www.swig.org/
   (needs 'development' version 1.3.9 or later).

Either:v

o "4Suite":http://www.4suite.org/ a pure Python XML/XSLT parsing
   engine.

or:

o "libxml2-python":http://xmlsoft/XSLT/python.html, a Python interface
   to "libxml2/libxslt":http://xmlsoft.org/ (also required), the GNOME
   XML parser (This is a much faster C library-based parser.  Mmost
   recent GNU/Linux distributions will ship libxml2/libxslt as
   standard, but you may need to obtain libxml2-python as a separate
   package).

**Installation**

*** Make sure Python and Distutils are installed correctly ***

Installation should be as simple as going to the pypop directory,
and typing:

	'python setup.py install'


If you need to do additional configuration, e.g. changing the base
directory, please type 'python setup.py', or see the documentation for
Distutils.


**Testing**
