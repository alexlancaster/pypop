[Filters] 
;; specify which filters you want applied and the order in which you
;; want them applied.  separate each filter name with a colon.  for
;; each filter you specify there should be a corresponding section
;; heading secifying, at the minimum, the filterType.  an exception to
;; this is if you use one of four predefined filters: AnthonyNolan,
;; DigitBinning, CustomBinning, and Sequence.  if you invoke these
;; filters by name, pypop will look for a section heading and
;; associated option settings, or, if no corresponding section
;; headings exist, pypop will use the default settings for each
;; filter.  sequence translation should always happen after other
;; filters (if present) are applied.
;; the makeNewPopFile option will make a dump of the pop file as it
;; would appear after the filtering operations.  you may choose to
;; make a separate file for each locus, or put all of the loci
;; together.  the digit after the colon indicates at what point in the
;; filtering process to make the dump (i.e., 1 means to dump after the
;; first filter.)

[CustomBinning]
;; you can provide a set of custom rules for replacing alleles use the
;; following example as a template.  allele names should be separated
;; by / marks.  this filter match any allele names that are exactly
;; the same as the ones you list here, and will also find "close
;; matches" (but only if there are no exact matches.)  in the
;; following example, A*03 alleles will match to 01/02/03, except for
;; A*0306, which will match to 04/05/0306.  if you place a * mark in
;; front of the first allele name, that one will be used as the "new
;; name" for the binned group (for example, A*0805 will be called 07
;; in the binned data.)  note that the space at the beginning of the
;; lines (following the first line of each locus) is important.  the
;; detault rules provided here are compiled from those used by mack et
;; al. (2007) 13th ihwg, and from the anthony nolan website list of
;; deleted allele names (found at
;; http://www.anthonynolan.com/HIG/lists/delnames.html )

[Sequence]
;; this determines the files that will be examined in order to read in
;; a sequence for each allele.  (ie, if the file for locus A is
;; A_prot.msf, the value would be _prot whereas if you wanted to use
;; the nucleotide sequence files, you might use _nuc)
sequenceFileSuffix=_prot

;; from ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/imgt/mhc/hla/

;; sequenceConsensusMethod describes how the sequence filter of pypop extracts
;; consensus sequences from msf files.  in the default behavior, the
;; sequence filter will assign a residue/nucleotide only if there is
;; perfect agreement among the higher resolution alleles.  the
;; "greedy" option means that a residue/nucleotide will be assigned
;; even if one, or more, of the higher resolution alleles has missing
;; sequence data at a particular position.  note that this option only
;; affects alleles which do not match exactly with a name present in
;; the alignment file.
;sequenceConsensusMethod=greedy


;[RandomAlleleBinning]
;; set binningMethod to either random or sequence.  use
;; binningStartPoint to tell PyPop at what point (in the application
;; of selected filters) it should examine the configuration of the
;; allele count data.  use 0 to tell PyPop to use the configuration
;; found in the pop file prior to any filtering.  use 1 to indicate
;; that you want to use the allele counts after the first filter, and
;; so on.  the end point is always after the last filter.  note that
;; you should not use the sequence filter in conjunction with this
;; random binning setting.
