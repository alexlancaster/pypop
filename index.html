<h3>
<a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

<p>PyPop (Python for Population Genomics) is an environment developed by the Thomson lab for doing large-scale population genetic analyses including: (1) conformity to Hardy-Weinberg expectations, (2) tests for balancing or directional selection; (3) estimates of haplotype frequencies (and their distributions) and measures and tests of significance for linkage disequilibrium (LD).</p>

<p>It is an object-oriented framework implemented in <a href="http://www.pypop.org">Python</a>, a language with powerful features for interfacing with other languages, such as C (in which we have already implemented many routines and which is particularly suited to computationally intensive tasks).</p>

<p>The output of the analyses are stored in the XML. These output files can then be transformed using standard tools into many other data formats suitable for machine input (such as PHYLIP or input for spreadsheet programs such as Excel or statistical packages, such as R, plain text, or HTML for human-readable format. Storing the output in XML allows the final viewable output format to be redesigned at will, without requiring the (often time-consuming) re-running of the analyses themselves.</p>

<p>An outline of PyPop can be found in our 2007 <em>Tissue Antigens</em> and 2003 <em>PSB</em> [[papers|cite]]
.
PyPop (beta) is available for download</p>

<ul>
<li>2008-09-09: 0.7.0 release (many new features and bug fixes) ← Most recent</li>
<li>2005-04-13: 0.6.0 released (new features and bug fixes)</li>
<li>2004-03-09: 0.5.2 released (bug fix release, fixes Windows 98 .bat file problems)</li>
<li>2004-02-26: 0.5.1 released (mainly a bug fix and maintainance release)</li>
<li>2003-12-31: 0.5 released (first public beta)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="binaries" class="anchor" href="#binaries" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Binaries</h3>

<p>Beta binary versions of PyPop are now publicly available (see "Getting and installing PyPop" link below for links to the current binaries) for both:</p>

<ul>
<li>GNU/Linux (the Linux binary needs a recent distribution that a recent glibc (2.8 has been tested): Fedora Core 9 is known to work, earlier versions of Red Hat such as the 7.x series and 8.0 are known to not work)</li>
<li>Official Fedora package available! As of early 2009, pypop is also an official Fedora package which works with Fedora 9 and later. (It is also available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (RHEL 5) if you install the optional EPEL add-on repository). You can install via yum using:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>yum install pypop
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Windows (the binary has been tested on Windows 98, 2000 and XP)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both binary packages are approximately 5.5 Mb downloads.
