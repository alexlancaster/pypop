Abbreviations: HW Hardy Weinberg, HWP HW proportions

Values that later will be output are indicated with underscores with their
first definition

You don't have to use the names I have given if there is reason not
to, there is however logic to the names I have used, although they
are very cumbersome.

Input: from previous data input phase

_locus name_

_sample size N_ (are you calling this by locus name, e.g., NA (sample
size for locus A), NDRB1 (locus DRB1), etc. or ? e.g, including
population name also - below I will refer to this as N with the
understanding that this number is population and locus specific,
i.e., sample size per locus may vary even within a population)


number of alleles k (again you may be calling this by locus name also
or ?, as will vary across loci)

allele frequencies pi, i=1,2,...,k (how many decimal places are you
working to, always work to as many as possible, even though we will
only output to a certain number of decimal places (to be decided re
output of data input phase allele frequencies))

observed genotype count AiAj for i<=j, i,j=1,2,...,k, and call these
HWobsgenoctAiAj

parameter space: there will be k homozygote classes AiAi, i =
1,2,...,k, and k(k-1)/2 heterozygote AiAj, i<j, i,j = 1,2,...,k
classes, for a total of k(k+1)/2 classes, e.g., k=2, total = 3, 2
homozygote (A1A1, A2A2), 1 heterozygote (A1A2), and k=4, total = 10,
4 homozygote (A1A1, A2A2, A3A3, A4A4), 6 heterozygote (A1A2, A1A3,
A1A4, A2A3, A2A4, A3A4).

(sometimes I need to distinguish between i<=j and i<j below in
calculations for example of expected values)

We require that number of alleles be > 1 to perform any of these tests,
if k = 1, then output message 'number of alleles = 1 no HW tests can
be performed" and exit this subroutine

Output:

pop name, ethnicity code, lab name, locus name, sample size (N = ??),
number of alleles (k = ??), allele names, counts, frequencies.

N.B. Add counter for case where k = 1

All this is done in the file parsing, called in order to read in
the data to be passed to the HWP programme.

A. Chi-square test of fit to HW

Logic:
  Calculate expected genotype values based on Hardy Weinberg
proportions for individual genotype values and test for fit to HWP
of individual genotypes as well as an overall test. When expected
genotype counts are >= 5 calculate individual chi-square value for this
genotype, i.e., (O - E)^2 / E, where O is observed and E is expected
for that genotype, test fit to null hypothesis (no deviation from HWP)
of this chi-square value with 1 degree of freedom and output p value,
and calculate cumulative chi-square value for all genotypes in this
category.
  If there are no genotypes with expected count < 5, then cumulative
chi-square value is tested against the null hypothesis of fit to HWP.
Degrees of freedom = k(k - 1) / 2, calculated from total number
of genotypes minus one minus the number of independent parameters
estimated from the data (i.e., k * (k + 1) / 2 - 1 - (k - 1) =
k * (k - 1) / 2.).
  When expected genotype counts are <5 form a lumped category
of observed and expected values for all these genotypes, and test
fit to null hypothesis (no deviation from HWP) of this chi-square
value with 1 degree of freedom and output p value. The chi-square
value from this category is added to the cumulative chi-square value
from the genotypes >= 5 class to give the overall chi-square value
which is tested against the null hypothesis of fit to HWP, degrees of
freedom equals the number of genotypes falling into >= 5 class, minus
the number of independent parameters estimated (This number will equal
the number of different alleles seen in the common genotype classes.
The overall degrees of freedom may be zero or negative, in which case
the chi-square test cannot be performed.), and output p value.
  The contribution of the common genotypes to the overall chi-square
test (without the lumped category) will also be considered.
  The p value from the overall test will also be compared to the
p value from the Guo and Thompson test with reduced number of alleles
in a meta analysis at a later date. The individual heterozygote p
values from Chen test (see later) will also be output and compared
to individual values from the chi-square test.

Calculate expected genotype counts under HWP, same parameter space as
for observed counts

_HWexpgenoctAiAi_ = N * (p[i])^2, // homozygotes
_HWexpgenoctAiAj_ = 2 * N * p[i] * p[j], i < j

Check that sum of these is close to N, say within 0.1% (may have to
fiddle with this later), maybe output to see where the values fall

Calculate individual genotype contributions to the chi-square value
and cumulative values for the overall chi-square value, set all the
following values initially to 0 (zero) before starting the iterative
calculations

HWcountercommongenos, HWdfcommon, HWcumchisqcommons,
HWcounterraregenos, HWobsgenoctlum, HWexpgenoctlum, HWchisq, HWchisqdf,
HWchisqpval, HWchisqlum, HWchisqlumpval, and all initialized to zero.

for i = 1, 2, ..., k,
  counter A[i] = 0

for i,j = 1,2,...,k, i <= j 

  HWprintexpAiAj, HWchisqAiAj, HWchisqpvalAiAj set to 0

do the following for all i,j = 1,2,...,k, i<=j
  (i)
  If HWexpgenoctAiAj is >= 5, for i <= j, then

  counter A[i] += 1
  counter A[j] += 1
  (This counts number of common genotype categories in which alleles
  A[i] and A[j] appear, homozygotes give a count of 2;  these are used
  later to determine if an allele ever appears in a common genotype,
  i.e., if counter > 0, and hence to determine degrees of freedom for
  common genotypes.)

  HWprintexpAiAj = 1 (this is a counter to tell us later to print the
  HWchisqAiAj value, set to zero initially),

  HWcountercommongenos = HWcountercommongenos (set counter = zero to
  start with) + 1,

  calculate cumulative degrees of freedom,

  calculate contribution of this genotype to the chi-square value,
  HWchisqAiAj = (HWobsgenoctAiAj - HWexpgenoctAiAj)2 / HWexpgenoctAiAj,

  for this chi-square value (HWchisqAiAj) and degrees of freedom 1,
  look up the p value and call this HWchisqpvalAiAj and calculate
  cumulative chi-square value for these genotypes

  HWcumchisqcommons =  HWcumchisqcommons (set counter = zero to start
  with) + HWchisqAiAj

  (ii)
  If HWexpgenoctAiAj is < 5, for i < = j, then

  HWprintexpAiAj = 99 (this is a counter to tell us later not to print the HWchisqAiAj value),

  HWcounterraregenos = HWcounterraregenos (set counter = zero to start
  with) + 1, and combine together in one class each the observed and
  expected genotype count values in these cases

  HWobsgenoctlum = HWobsgenoctlum (set counter = zero to start with)
  + HWobsgenoctAiAj, and

  HWexpgenoctlum = HWexpgenoctlum (set counter = zero to start with)
  + HWexpgenoctAiAj,

when have gone through all i,j values

(iii)
If HWcounterraregenos = 0, calculate
  HWchisq = HWcumchisqcommons 
  HWchisqdf = k * (k - 1) / 2
  for this chi-square value (HWchisq) and degrees of freedom
  (HWchisqdf), look up the p value and call this HWchisqpval

  Output:
  No rare genotypes with expected < 5 observed
  HWchisq = ??, HWchisqdf = ??, HWchisqpval = ??, (?? means insert value, ns
  if not significant)
  Do for i <=j = 1, 2, .., k
    If HWprintA[i]A[j] == 1
      Output:
      HWobsgenoctA[i]A[j] = ??   HWexpgenoctA[i]A[j] = ??
      HWchisq[i]A[j] = ??   HWchisqpval[i]A[j] = ??
      e.g.:
      A1A2 15, 10, 2.5, ns (not significant)
      and have header:
      genotype, HWobsgenoct, HWexpgenoct, HWchisq, HWpval


/*--mpn-- STOP HERE for now 2001-10-26*/
(iv)
If HWcountercommongenos = 0
  Output 'no common genotypes chi-square cannot be calculated'

(v)
otherwise, calculate:

  HWchisqlum = (HWobsgenoctlum - HWexpgenoctlum)2 / HWexpgenoctlum
  this is (O-E)2/E for the 1 class of lumped data for the genotypes
  with low expected values, i.e., <=5

for this chi-square value (HWchisqlum) and degrees of freedom 1, look up the p value and call this HWchisqlumpval (I need to work out later automation of case where total expected here is less than 5, for moment will do by eye from outputs)
and calculate
HWchisq = HWcumchisqcommons + HWchisqlum
HWchisqdf = HWdfcommon + 1,
for this chi-square value (HWchisq) and degrees of freedom (HWchisqdf), look up the p value and call this HWchisqpval

see output format later

B. Guo and Thompson test of fit to HW
Run Guo and Thompson exact test on 2 sets of data (i) all alleles, and (ii) a reduced set of alleles eliminating rare alleles
set the following values initially to 0 (zero) before starting thecalcuations
HWGTpval, HWkGTlum, HWGTpval, 
(i) use all alleles and call the resulting p value HWGTpval and output
(ii) using a reduced set of alleles with all alleles with observed count <= 10 combined in a class called GTlum (this value of 10 may be changed later), count the new adjusted number of alleles HWkGTlum and call the resulting p value from running Guo and Thompson test HWGTlumpval, and output HWkGTlum and HWGTlumpval.
(there is a lot more output from GT test, not sure if we need to output any of this other than p value, needs to be looked at)

C. John Chen test of individual heterozygote deviations from HW
Parameters for i,j = 1,2,...,k, i<j set HWChenAiAj values all to zero, then run John Chen's program and output for heterozygotes only, with HWexpgenoctAiAj >=5 only, the p value from John's program for this genotype, call this HWChenAiAj.

Output
locus name, sample size N = ??, number of alleles k = ?? (depending on flow from previous ouput, e.g., allele frequencies, we may not need to output these)
HWchisq = ??, HWchisqdf = ??, HWchisqpval = ??,
(If HWcountercommongenos = 0, output 'no common genotypes, chi-square cannot be calculated' in lieu of the above, and in lieu of the following line also)
HWobsgenoctlum = ??, HWexpgenoctlum = ??, HWchisqlum = ??, HWchisqlumpval = ??,
(If HWcounterraregenos is = 0, output nc = no counts for these 2 values)
HWGTpval = ??, HWGTlumpval= ??, HWkGTlum = ??

Output a matrix, off diagonal, with allele names and values given below, will have to fiddle with format of output, spacing etc.

	A1	A2	A3	........					Ak
A1	v11	v12	v13						v1k
A2	-	v22	v23						v2k
A3	-	-	v33						v3k

Ak	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	vkk

where v denotes the following values for homozygotes and heterozygotes where appropriate, - or some other notation to mean no value output, or leave blank?

vii adn vij, i<j values are as follows
HWobsgenoctAiAj
HWexpgenoctAiAj
HWchisqAiAj if HWprintexpAiAj = 1, if HWprintexpAiAj = 99, then output nc for not calculated
HWchisqpvalAiAj if HWprintexpAiAj = 1, if HWprintexpAiAj = 99, then output e.g., nc for not calculated
HWChenAiAj if HWprintexpAiAj = 1, and for heterozygotes only, if HWprintexpAiAj = 99, then output nc for not calculated, and if homozygote output nc also.
