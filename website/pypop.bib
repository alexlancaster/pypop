  abstract = {In histocompatibility testing some genotype ambiguities are almost always resolved into the genotype with the most common alleles. To achieve unambiguous assignments additional unwieldy tests are performed. The American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics formed a committee to define what human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes do not need to be resolved in external proficiency testing. The tasks included detailed analysis of large datasets of high-resolution typing and thorough review of the pertinent scientific literature. Strict criteria were used to create a catalogue of common and well-documented (CWD) alleles. In total, 130, 245, 81, and 143 of the highly polymorphic HLA-A, -B, -C, and DRB1 loci fell into the CWD category; these represent 27\%--30\% of all alleles recognized. For the loci DRB3/4/5, DQA1, DQB1, and DPB1, a total of 29, 16, 26, and 52 CWD alleles were identified. A recommendation indicated that an acceptable report should only include one possible genotype; multiple genotypes can only be reported if only one of these includes two alleles of the CWD group. Exceptions in which resolution is not necessary are ambiguities involving functional alleles with identical sequences in the antigen recognition site. The criteria were established for proficiency testing, which could be a valuable tool when making clinical histocompatibility decisions.},

Eighty of 99 overall tests fit the Hardy-Weinberg expectation (73\% for DRB1, 89\% for DQA1, 81\% for DQB1 and 81\% for DPB1). Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions were both locus and group specific.

In this incisive and authoritative book, Harald Cram{\'e}r unites these two major lines of development, providing a masterly exposition of the mathematical methods of modern statistics that set the standard in the field still followed today.Requiring only a working knowledge of undergraduate mathematics, this self-contained book begins with an introduction to the fundamental concept of a distribution and of integration with respect to a distribution. It goes on to discuss the general theory of random variables and probability distributions, the theory of sampling, statistical estimation, and tests of significance.Blending lucid and accessible writing with mathematical rigor, Mathematical Methods of Statistics belongs on the shelf of anyone interested in statistical methods and remains the standard reference on the subject today.},

In view of the large amount of data currently being obtained by electrophoretic methods on allele frequencies and numbers, and the current interest in the possibility of extensive ``non-Darwinian'' evolution, such a sampling theory seems necessary.

  abstract = {Molecular techniques allow the survey of a large number of linked polymorphic loci in random samples from diploid populations. However, the gametic phase of haplotypes is usually unknown when diploid individuals are heterozygous at more than one locus. To overcome this difficulty, we implement an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm leading to maximum-likelihood estimates of molecular haplotype frequencies under the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg proportions. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated for simulated data representing both DNA sequences and highly polymorphic loci with different levels of recombination. As expected, the EM algorithm is found to perform best for large samples, regardless of recombination rates among loci. To ensure finding the global maximum likelihood estimate, the EM algorithm should be started from several initial conditions. The present approach appears to be useful for the analysis of nuclear DNA sequences or highly variable loci. Although the algorithm, in principle, can accommodate an arbitrary number of loci, there are practical limitations because the computing time grows exponentially with the number of polymorphic loci.

Because of its importance, much attention has been devoted to tests of Hardy-Weinberg proportions (HWP) over the decades. It has long been recognized that large-sample goodness-of-fit tests can sometimes lead to spurious results when the sample size and/or some genotypic frequencies are small. Although a complete enumeration algorithm for the exact test has been proposed, it is not of practical use for loci with more than a few alleles due to the amount of computation required. We propose two algorithms to estimate the significance level for a test of HWP. The algorithms are easily applicable to loci with multiple alleles. Both are remarkably simple and computationally fast. Relative efficiency and merits of the two algorithms are compared. Guidelines regarding their usage are given. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the practicality of the algorithms.},

In addition, the measures suggested by A. H. D. Brown, M. F. Feldman and E. Nevo, and T. Ohta can have negative values when there is maximum disequilibrium and have rates of decay in infinite populations that are a function of the initial gametic array. The variances were large for all the measures in samples taken from populations at equilibrium under neutrality, with the measure based on D{$\prime$} having the lowest variance. In these samples, three of the measures were highly correlated, D2, D* (equal to the correlation coefficient when there are two alleles at each locus) and the measure X(2) of Brown et al. Using frequency-dependent measures may result in mistaken conclusions, a fact illustrated by discussion of studies inferring recombinational hot spots and the effects of population bottlenecks from disequilibrium values.},

In any given population one can estimate haplotype frequencies, identify deviation from Hardy--Weinberg equilibrium, test for balancing or directional selection, and investigate patterns of linkage disequilibrium. Existing software packages are oriented primarily toward the computation of such statistics on a population-by-population basis, not on comparisons among populations and across different statistics. We developed PyPop (Python for Population Genomics) to facilitate the analyses of population genetic statistics across populations and the relationships among different statistics within and across populations. PyPop is an open-source framework for performing large-scale population genetic analyses on multilocus genotype data. It computes the statistics described above, among others. PyPop deploys a standard Extensible Markup Language (XML) output format and can integrate the results of multiple analyses on various populations that were performed at different times into a common output format that can be read into a spreadsheet. The XML output format allows PyPop to be embedded as part of a larger analysis pipeline. Originally developed to analyze the highly polymorphic genetic data of the human leukocyte antigen region of the human genome, PyPop has applicability to any kind of multilocus genetic data. It is the primary analysis platform for analyzing data collected for the Anthropological component of the 13th and 14th International Histocompatibility Workshops. PyPop has also been successfully used in studies by our group, with collaborators, and in publications by several independent research teams.},

Statistics of allele frequency distributions, based on Watterson's homozygosity statistic F, reveal distinct evolutionary patterns for these loci in ethnically diverse samples (26 populations for DQB1 and DRB1 and 14 for DPB1). When examined over all populations, the DQB1 locus allelic variation exhibits striking balanced polymorphism (P \&lt; 10-4), DRB1 shows some evidence of balancing selection (P \&lt; 0.06), and while there is overall very little evidence for selection of DPB1 allele frequencies, there is a trend in the direction of balancing selection (P \&lt; 0.08). In contrast, at the amino acid level all three loci show strong evidence of balancing selection at some sites. Averaged over polymorphic amino acid sites, DQB1 and DPB1 show similar deviation from neutrality expectations, and both exhibit more balanced polymorphic amino acid sites than DRB1. Across ethnic groups, polymorphisms at many codons show evidence for balancing selection, yet data consistent with directional selection were observed at other codons. Both antigen-binding pocket- and non-pocket-forming amino acid sites show overall deviation from neutrality for all three loci. Only in the case of DRB1 was there a significant difference between pocket- and non-pocket-forming amino acid sites. Our findings indicate that balancing selection at the MHC occurs at the level of polymorphic amino acid residues, and that in many cases this selection is consistent across populations.},

  abstract = {Haplotype analyses are an important area in the study of the genetic components of human disease. Associations between markers and disease loci that are not evident with a single marker locus may be identified in multi-locus marker analyses using estimated haplotype frequencies (HFs). Procedures that make use of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate HFs from unphased genotype data are in common use in genetic studies. The EM algorithm uses these unphased genotype frequencies along with the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg proportions (HWP) to converge on HF estimates. In this paper, we assess the accuracy of EM estimates of HFs in patients with type I diabetes for whom the true haplotypes are known, but the data are analyzed ignoring family information to allow comparison between estimated and true frequencies. The data consist of six HLA loci with high levels of polymorphism and a range of departures from HWP and linkage equilibrium. While the overall accuracy of the EM estimates is good, there can be large over- and underestimates of particular HFs, even for common haplotypes, especially when the loci involved deviate significantly from HWP. Estimating HFs for three or more loci and then collapsing over loci so as to generate two locus haplotypes can improve the accuracy of the estimation. The collapsing procedure is most beneficial when one of the loci in the two-locus haplotype of interest deviates significantly from HWP and the locus collapsed over is in linkage disequilibrium with the other loci.

  abstract = {The exact test for neutrality based on the Ewens sampling distribution described previously (Slatkin, 1994) is not correct. The problem is that the test as described is based on the probability of the ordered configuration of numbers of alleles, while it should be based on the probability of the unordered configuration. The correctly implemented exact test leads to results that are similar to those from the homozygosity test proposed by Watterson (1977) for relatively small sample sizes but can still differ substantially for larger sample sizes. Programs to perform the exact test are available from the author.},

  abstract = {Using the Ewens sampling distribution of selectively neutral alleles in a finite population, it is possible to develop an exact test of neutrality by finding the probability of each configuration with the same sample size and observed number of allelic classes. The exact test provides the probability of obtaining a configuration with the same or smaller probability as the observed configuration under the null hypothesis. The results from the exact test may be quite different from those from the Ewens---Watterson test based on the homozygosity in the sample. The advantages and disadvantages of using an exact test in this and other population genetic contexts are discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a meta-analysis of high-resolution human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele frequency data describing 497 population samples. Most of the datasets were compiled from studies published in eight journals from 1990 to 2007; additional datasets came from the International Histocompatibility Workshops and from the AlleleFrequencies.net database. In all, these data represent approximately 66,800 individuals from throughout the world, providing an opportunity to observe trends that may not have been evident at the time the data were originally analyzed, especially with regard to the relative importance of balancing selection among the HLA loci. Population genetic measures of allele frequency distributions were summarized across populations by locus and geographic region. A role for balancing selection maintaining much of HLA variation was confirmed. Further, the breadth of this meta-analysis allowed the ranking of the HLA loci, with DQA1 and HLA-C showing the strongest balancing selection and DPB1 being compatible with neutrality. Comparisons of the allelic spectra reported by studies since 1990 indicate that most of the HLA alleles identified since 2000 are very-low-frequency alleles. The literature-based allele-count data, as well as maps summarizing the geographic distributions for each allele, are available online.},

  abstract = {For multiallelic loci, standard measures of linkage disequilibrium provide an incomplete description of the correlation of variation at two loci, especially when there are different numbers of alleles at the two loci. We have developed a complementary pair of conditional asymmetric linkage disequilibrium (ALD) measures. Since these measures do not assume symmetry, they more accurately describe the correlation between two loci and can identify heterogeneity in genetic variation not captured by other symmetric measures. For biallelic loci the ALD are symmetric and equivalent to the correlation coefficient r. The ALD measures are particularly relevant for disease-association studies to identify cases in which an analysis can be stratified by one of more loci. A stratified analysis can aid in detecting primary disease-predisposing genes and additional disease genes in a genetic region. The ALD measures are also informative for detecting selection acting independently on loci in high linkage disequilibrium or on specific amino acids within genes. For SNP data, the ALD statistics provide a measure of linkage disequilibrium on the same scale for comparisons among SNPs, among SNPs and more polymorphic loci, among haplotype blocks of SNPs, and for fine mapping of disease genes. The ALD measures, combined with haplotype-specific homozygosity, will be increasingly useful as next-generation sequencing methods identify additional allelic variation throughout the genome.},

It is here shown that homozygosity is also influenced by the presence of deleterious alleles and by other departures from neutrality, but at a lower order of magnitude of effect if the selection coefficients are of the same small order of magnitude. Tables are provided for the significance points and moments of the homozygosity, under the null hypothesis of neutrality.},
