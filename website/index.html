<h1 align="center">PyPop: Python for Population Genetics</h1>

  <p><strong>PyPop</strong>
   (<em>Py</em>thon for <em>Pop</em>ulation
   Genetics) is an environment developed by the Thomson lab
    for doing large-scale population genetic
   analyses including: (1) conformity to Hardy-Weinberg expectations, (2) tests
    for balancing or directional selection; (3) estimates of haplotype
    frequencies (and their distributions) and measures and tests of
    significance for linkage disequilibrium (LD). </p>

  <p>It is in an
   object-oriented framework implemented in the programming language
   Python.  <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> is a flexible scripting
   language which allows rapid prototyping of code and has powerful
   features for interfacing with other languages, such as C (in which
   we have already implemented many routines and which is particularly
   suited to computationally intensive tasks).</p>

  <p>The output of the
   analyses are stored in the XML format (XML is the eXtensible Markup
   Language devised by the World Wide Web Consortium, and is a
   platform-independent, vendor-neutral, non-proprietary, open
   standard for storing data).  These
   output files can then be transformed using standard tools into many
   other data formats suitable for machine input (such as
   PHYLIP or input for  spreadsheet
   programs such as Excel or statistical
   packages, such as R,  plain text, or HTML
   for human-readable format.  Storing the output in XML allows the
   final viewable output format to be redesigned at will, without
   requiring the (often time-consuming) re-running of the analyses
   themselves.</p>
