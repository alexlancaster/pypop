2003-12-05  Alex Lancaster  <alexl AT socrates.berkeley.edu>

	* setup.py (ext_Emhaplofreq): Add "depends" for module on
	'emhaplofreq/emhaplofreq.h'.  Only enable this for Python > 2.1,
	[feature added in 2.2 or 2.3].
	(ext_Pvalue, ext_Gthwe): Likewise for pval/*.h and gthwe/*.h
	files.

2003-12-05  Alex Lancaster  <alexl AT socrates.berkeley.edu>

	* pypop.py (usage_message): Add new "-o", "--outputdir" option to
	allow user to specify alternative directory for output and pass
	through to invocation of Main. If directory does not exist, exit
	with an error.  Replace getXmlOutFilename -> getXmlPath and
	likewise for getTxtOutFilename -> getTxtOutPath.
	
	* Main.py (Main.__init__): Add new parameter outputDir for
	allowing different output directories and set as instance
	variable.  If set, prepend outputDir
	to {xmlOut,txtOut,defaultFilterLog}Filename to create
	corresponding {xmlOut,txtOut,defaultFilterLog}Path variables.
	Use them in all "open()" functions.
	(Main._genTextOutput): Likewise.
	(Main.getXmlOutPath): Rename from getXmlOutFilename.
	(Main.getTxtOutPath): Likewise for getTxtOutPath.

2003-11-26  Alex Lancaster  <alexl AT socrates.berkeley.edu>

	* Main.py (Main.__init__): Moved filterLogFile creation to the
	first if statement to check for the presence of the '[Filters]'
	section in the configuration file, so that when _runFilters is
	reached the file exists at that point.

	* Utils.py (StringMatrix.__setitem__): Remove ugly hack to that
	appended a colon to each item in StringMatrix.
	(StringMatrix.filterOut.f): Remove colon check.
	(appendTo2dList): New function to append a given string to each
	element in a two 2d list (i.e. a list of lists).
	(__main__): Tweak test harness.

	* Haplo.py: Import new function appendTo2dList from Utils.py
	(Emhaplofreq._runEmhaplofreq): Use it to add colon ':', when
	generating the subMatrix to pass to the Emhaplofreq module.
	Remove the truncation from the debug message as well.

	* DataTypes.py (Genotypes._genDataStructures): Remove FIXME hack
	for Utils.py, don't need to lop-off trailing colon.

	* Filter.py (AnthonyNolanFilter.doFiltering): Likewise
	(AnthonyNolanFilter.makeSeqDictionaries): Likewise.
	(AnthonyNolanFilter.translateMatrix): Likewise.
	(BinningFilter.doDigitBinning): Likewise.

2003-11-26  Alex Lancaster  <alexl AT socrates.berkeley.edu>

	* Main.py (Main.__init__): Set randomBinningFlag instance variable
	to off (0) by default, so it always exists.
	Move the creation of the filterLogFile to same place that the
	inline XML pointing to the filter log is created.
	Close log file *after* running _do*File() methods moving it here,
	means that the open and close are at the same level and are called
	in the same method.
	(Main._runFilters): Move setting of randomBinningFlag to __init__
	Likewise for filterLogFile open() and close().

2003-11-26  Alex Lancaster  <alexl AT socrates.berkeley.edu>

	* Utils.py (StringMatrix.copy): Don't forget to copy the internal
	array too!
	(__main__): Modify test harness slightly.

2003-11-25 Owen Solberg  <solberg AT socrates.berkeley.edu>
	
	* Homozygosity.py: Import add from operator.
	(Homozygosity.getObservedHomozygosity): Change to reflect new data
	structure above.
	(HomozygosityEWSlatkinExact.__init__): Likewise change interface.
	(HomozygosityEWSlatkinExact._doCalcs): New method, split out from
	__init__ so we can reuse the object with new alleleData without
	having to instantiate a new instance.  Move extraction of data
	from wrapper from serializeHomozygosityTo method into new instance
	variables, so we can return data outside the stream context.
	(HomozygosityEWSlatkinExact.getHomozygosity): Return data as a
	tuple, acquired in _doCalcs.
	(HomozygosityEWSlatkinExact.serializeHomozygosityTo): Call
	_doCalcs as per old interface.
	(HomozygosityEWSlatkinExact.serializeHomozygosityTo): Populate
	XML stream with data from new instance variables .
	(Homozygosity.__init__): Change interface: now takes
	alleleData (list of counts), directly, avoids having to unpack
	data structure.

	* config.ini ([Filters]): New section, new 'filtersToApply' option
	can specifiy arbitrary filters, that each have their own section.
	([Filter1], [Filter2]): Sample configs for AnthonyNolan and
	DigitBinning filter, respectively.
	([Sequence]): New section, sample configuration for translating
	alleles and running entire analysis at sequence level (if section
	not present, won't do this).
	([RandomAlleleBinning]): New section to configure behaviour of
	random binning.

	* RandomBinning.py: New file.  
	(RandomAlleleBinning): New class to handle creation of random
	binning code in modular fashion.

	* Filter.py: Import deepcopy from copy.
	(AnthonyNolanFilter): Doc string.
	(AnthonyNolanFilter.__init__): New keyword options:
	alleleFileFormat (default: 'msf'), and alleleDesignator (default:
	'*'), sequenceFileSuffix ('_prot') for handling different kind of
	data.
	Handle MSF files in addition to text ones..
	Don't call self.cleanup (may need to write more to the log file).
	(AnthonyNolanFilter.makeSeqDictionaries): New method, split out
	from __init__ to make the the sequence dictionary creation
	externally available.
	(AnthonyNolanFilter.translateMatrix): New method, likewise split
	out from __init__.
	(AnthonyNolanFilter._getSequenceFromLines): New method to get
	sequence for MSF files.
	(AnthonyNolanFilter._getConsensusFromLines): New method, gets
	consensus sequences.
	(BinningFilter): Reworked the BinningFilter class.  Handles
	digitBinning, comment out old CustomBinning for the moment, it is
	broken against new interface.

	* Main.py: From Filter, import MSFilter.
	(getUserFilenameInput): Fix doc string.
	(Main.__init__): Make defaultFilterLogFile an instance variable.
	(Main.__init__): Likewise for alleleDesignator.
	(Main.__init__): Completely refactor filtering: we now look for a
	'[Filter]' section in the .ini file.  We can concatenate these
	filters arbitrarily and each successive matrix is saved.  We run
	filters just before we create the Genotypes matrix.  Remove
	useAnthonyNolanFilter option from [ParseGenotypeFile].
	Moved filterLog file creation out of AnthonyNolanFilter to here.
	(Main._runFilters): New method, which implements the checking of
	filters.  To emulate old filters we have some sensible defaults,
	"AnthonyNolan" will behave like the old filter, and obviates the
	need for a special "flag" in [ParseFile].  Filters that can
	currently be used are: AnthonyNolanFilter (can use the MSF format
	for parsing), DigitBinning, CustomBinnning, or Sequence (to
	translate in a nucleotide or amino-acid sequence).
	(Main._doGenotypeFile): Handle the change to the interface for
	Homozygosity object, currently only requires the list of count
	values, not the whole dictionary.  
	Implement preliminary code for doing randomized "binning": both in
	the truly random and "phylogenetically informed" way.
	FIXME: Close the filterLog file here (currently broken if no
	filters are used).
