	* hwe.c (run_data): Don't hardcode length of a[] and n[] arrays,
	make them simply be pointers.  
	(run_data): After DEBUG, fflush() stdout.

	sample.group and sample.size initializations were switched, switch
	them to the correct initializations.

	* to_calculate_log.c (log_factorial): Use gsl_sf_lnfact() function
	from the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) in place of the original log
	factorial function, which can't handle large enought numbers.

	* random_choose.c (random_choose): Make work variable dynamically
	allocated using calloc() and free() at end of function.

2002-08-30  Alex Lancaster  <alex at berkeley dot edu>

	* Makefile (CFLAGS):  Add -Wall.

2002-03-23  Alex Lancaster  <alex at berkeley dot edu>

	* hwe.c:
	In XML_OUTPUT mode only, output parameters used in gthwe's MCMC
	algorithm: sample.{step,group,size} as dememorizationSteps,
	samplingNum and samplingSize, respectively.

2002-02-06  Alex Lancaster  <alex at berkeley dot edu>

	* hwe.c:
	Change <hardyweinberg-guo-thompson> tag to <hardyweinbergGuoThompson>.

2002-01-31  Alex Lancaster  <alex at berkeley dot edu>

	* hwe.c:
	Change XML tag output to <hardyweinberg-guo-thompson>, reserve "role"
	attribute for qualifying this kind of output.

	* hwe.c:
	(run_data()): New function.  Does the "heavy-lifting" for the program,
	most of the code originally in "main()" moved here.  Accepts the
	variables and arrays parsed in by the check_file() and read_data() and
	can be called by external programs or be made into an * extension
	function in languages like Python using SWIG.
	(init_rand()): New function.  All code that originally did set-up for
	random numbers is now done here, it is the first thing called within
	run_data().
	(main()): Most code "out-sourced" to run_data() and init_rand(), is
	now the command-line shell around these functions, simply calls
	check_file() and read_data(), the farms the result out to run_data().

	* func.h: Add declarations for init_rand(), run_data() functions.

	* stamp_time.c:
	(stamp_time()): fprintf formats was missing "ld" for "long" type.

	* print_data.c: (print_data()): Register type was missing "int" type.

	* check_file.c: (check_file()): Add missing return type of int.

	* gthwe_wrap.i: Fix comment.

	* gthwe_wrap.i:
	Added SWIG wrapper for gthwe.  Calls the new run_data() function.

2002-01-30  Alex Lancaster  <alex at berkeley dot edu>

	* hwe.c: Fix comments to refer to "gthwe" not "hwe".

	* check_file.c: Fix usage message to be "gthwe" not "hwe".

	* README.1: Update README.1 with new information about CFLAGS.

	* Makefile, hwe.c, print_data.c, stamp_time.c:
	Merge XML_BRANCH back into main branch, fix conflicts and make XML output
	be well-formed.
	Now provide two #defines: XML_BRANCH to produce XML output, and
	SUPPRESS_ALLELE_TABLE which suppresses the generation of the allele
	frequency table, these options can be set independently of one
	another.  They are off by default, output defaults to complete
	old-style text output.

2001-09-21  Alex Lancaster  <alex at berkeley dot edu>

	* README.1: Note addition of SUPPRESS_TABLE in README.1

	* Makefile (CFLAGS):
	Set SUPPRESS_TABLE to true so that genotype freq table is
	not generated by default.

	* hwe.c (main):
	If SUPPRESS_TABLE #define is set, don't call (print_data), i.e
	don't print out observed genotype file.

2001-03-09  Alex Lancaster  <alex at berkeley dot edu>

	* Makefile, hwe.c, print_data.c, stamp_time.c: XML changes

2000-11-30  Alex Lancaster  <alex at berkeley dot edu>

	* gthwe: Really remove it...

	* Makefile, gthwe: Tune Makefile.
	Remove executable binary.

2000-11-29  Mark P. Nelson  <mpn@allele5.biol.berkeley.edu>

	* Makefile, README.1, cal_const.c, cal_n.c, cal_prob.c,
	check_file.c, do_switch.c, example.dat, example.gtout, func.h,
	gthwe, hwe.c, hwe.h, ln_p_value.c, new_rand.c, print_data.c,
	random_choose.c, read_data.c, select_index.c, stamp_time.c,
	test_switch.c, to_calculate_log.c: John Chen's adaptation of
	Sun-Wei Guo's Hardy-Weinberg exact prog

	* Makefile, README.1, cal_const.c, cal_n.c, cal_prob.c,
	check_file.c, do_switch.c, example.dat, example.gtout, func.h,
	gthwe, hwe.c, hwe.h, ln_p_value.c, new_rand.c, print_data.c,
