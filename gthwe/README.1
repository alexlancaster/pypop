The program, gthwe, performs "exact" overall HWP testing. It was
modified from the original Guo-Thompson programs (see Guo and Thompson
(Biometrics 1992) for details and the original program
documentations). One major change was a new random number
generator. The number of "dememorization" steps, the number of
samplings, and the sampling size were set at: 2,000, 1,000, and
1,000. These can be changed in the input data file.

To run:

./gthwe GenotypeFrequencyFile OutputFile

The GenotypeFrequencyFile has the standard format as in Guo and
Thompson (1992). An example file, example.dat, is provided in this
directory. The "exact" P-value can be found in the OutputFile,
example.gtout.

Notes added by Alex Lancaster:

2002-02-30: By default text output is produced.  If XML output is
desired, please enable it by adding "-DXML_OUTPUT=1" to the CFLAGS
variable in the Makefile.

2001-09-20: By default the observed genotype lower-triangular matrix
is generated.  If you desire to suppress this feature simply add the
"-DSUPPRESS_ALLELE_TABLE=1" to the CFLAGS variable in the Makefile.
