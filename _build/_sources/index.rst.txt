PyPop: Python for Population Genomics
=====================================

.. warning::
   
    The old 0.7.0 binary releases based on Python 2, are deprecated
    and will no install or work on many platforms. Please follow the
    instructions on the GitHub `README.rst
    <https://github.com/alexlancaster/pypop#readme>`__ for how to
    install one of the Python 3-based pre-releases, or build PyPop
    from source on a modern Python 3 system.

.. _guide-preface-1-start:

**PyPop (Python for Population Genomics)** is an environment for doing
large-scale population genetic analyses including:

-  conformity to Hardy-Weinberg expectations

-  tests for balancing or directional selection

-  estimates of haplotype frequencies and measures and tests of
   significance for linkage disequilibrium (LD).

It is an object-oriented framework implemented in `Python
<http://www.pypop.org/>`__, a language with powerful features for
interfacing with other languages, such as C (in which we have already
implemented many routines and which is particularly suited to
computationally intensive tasks).

The output of the analyses are stored in XML. These output files can
then be transformed using standard tools into many other data formats
suitable for machine input (such as PHYLIP or input for spreadsheet
programs such as Excel or statistical packages, such as R), plain
text, or HTML for human-readable format. Storing the output in XML
allows the final viewable output format to be redesigned at will,
without requiring the (often time-consuming) re-running of the
analyses themselves.

An outline of PyPop can be found in our 2007 *Tissue Antigens* and
2003 *PSB* :ref:`papers <citing-pypop>`.
