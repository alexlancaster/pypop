* Release Notes for PyPop 0.6.0 (public beta) [not released yet]
** New features
*** New command-line option '-f' (long version '--filelist') which
    accepts a file containing a list of files (one per line) to
    process (note that this is mutually exclusive with supplying
    INPUTFILEs, and will abort with an error message if you supply
    both simultaneously).
*** In batch version, handle multiple INPUTFILEs supplied as command-line
    arguments and support Unix shell-globbing syntax (e.g. 'pypop.py
    -c config.ini *.pop'). (NOTE: This is supported *only* in
    batch version, not in the interactive version, which expects one
    and only one file supplied by user.
** Bug fixes
*** Allow HardyWeinbergGuoThompson test to be run if at least two alleles
    present (test was originally failing with a 'too-few-alleles'
    message if there were not at least 3 alleles).  Thanks to Kristie
    Mather for the report.
*** Checks to see if a locus is monomorphic, if it is, it generates an 
    allele summary report, but skips the rest of the single locus
    analyses which do not make sense for monomorphic locus.  Thanks to
    Steve Mack and Owen Solberg for the bug report(s).
* Release Notes for PyPop 0.5.2 (public beta) 2004-03-09
** Bug fixes
*** Add missing RandomBinning.py file to source distribution
    Thanks to Hazael Maldonado Torres for the bug report.
*** Fixed line endings for .bat scripts for Win32 so they work under 
    Windows 98 thanks to Wendy Hartogensis for the bug report.

* Release Notes for PyPop 0.5.1 (public beta) 2004-02-26
** Changes
*** New parameter 'numInitCond', number of initial conditions by the
    haplotype estimation and LD algorithm used before performing
    permutations. Defaults to 50.
*** Remove some LOG messages/diagnostics that were erroneously implying
    an error to the user (if nothing is wrong, don't say anything).  Add
    some more useful messages for what is being done in haplo/LD 
    estimation step.
*** Add popmeta.py to the distribution: this is undocumented and unsupported 
    as yet, it is at alpha stage only, use at your own risk!

** Bug fixes
*** Remember to output plaintext version of LD for specified loci.

* Release Notes for PyPop 0.5 (public beta) 2003-12-31
** Changes
*** All Linux wrapper scripts no longer have .sh file suffixes for 
    consistency with DOS (all DOS bat files can be executed without
    specifying the .bat extension).

** Bug fixes
*** Add wrapper scripts for interactive and batch mode for 
    both DOS and Linux so that correct shared libraries are called.
*** Pause and wait for user to press a key at end of DOS .bat file
    so that output can be viewed before window close.
*** Set PYTHONHOME in wrapper scripts to prevent messages about 
    missing <prefix> being displayed.

* Release Notes for PyPop 0.4.3beta
** Bug fixes
*** Fixed bug in processing of 'popname' field. 
    Thanks to Richard Single for the report.
