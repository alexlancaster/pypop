* Release Notes for PyPop 0.5 (public beta)
** Changes
*** All Linux wrapper scripts no longer have .sh file suffixes for 
    consistency with DOS (all DOS bat files can be executed without
    specifying the .bat extension).

** Bug fixes
*** Add wrapper scripts for interactive and batch mode for 
    both DOS and Linux so that correct shared libraries are called.
*** Pause and wait for user to press a key at end of DOS .bat file
    so that output can be viewed before window close.

* Release Notes for PyPop 0.4.3beta
** Bug fixes
*** Fixed bug in processing of 'popname' field. 
    Thanks to Richard Single for the report.
