## Python for Population Genomics (PyPop)

PyPop is a framework for processing genotype and allele data and running analyses.

## Installation

### 1. Install OS-specific tools

#### MacOS X

1. install developer command-line tools: https://developer.apple.com/downloads/  (includes ```git```, ```gcc```)
2. Visit http://macports.org and follow the instructions there to install the latest version of MacPorts for your version of MacOS X.
3. Set environment variables to use macports version of Python and other packages, packages add the following to ```~/.bash_profile```

```
export PATH=/opt/local/bin:$PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib/:$LIBRARY_PATH
export CPATH=/opt/local/include:$CPATH
```

4. Rerun your bash shell login in order to make these new exports active in your environment.  At the command line type: 

```
exec bash -login
```

5. Check that the MacPorts version of Python is active by typing: ```which python```, if it is working correctly you should see the following:

```
/opt/local/bin/python
````

### 3. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/alexlancaster/pypop.git
  
### 4. Install external dependencies

* ```swig``` (Simple Wrapper Interface Generator) 
* ```gsl``` (GNU Scientific Library)
* ```Numeric``` (Python Numeric)
* ```libxml2/libxslt``` (Python bindings)

#### MacOS:

Install the MacPorts packages

      sudo port install swig-python gsl py27-numeric py-libxml2 py27-libxslt py-setuptools
      
Set MacPorts to use the just-installed 2.7 MacPorts version of Python:

      sudo port select --set python python27

#### Linux (Fedora/Centos/RHEL): 

Need at least Fedora 25 for the appropriate dependencies:

      sudo dnf install swig gsl-devel python-numeric python-libxml2 libxslt-python python-setuptools

See [DEV_NOTES.md](DEV_NOTES.md) for instructions on containerizing the install on a Centos/RHEL release.

#### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): 

      TBD
     
### 5. Build

    ./setup.py build

## Examples

These are examples of how to use PyPop. Specify the `--help` option to see an
explanation of the options available.

### Run a minimal dataset:

    ./bin/pypop.py -c  data/samples/minimal.ini data/samples/USAFEL-UchiTelle-small.pop

This will generate the following two files, an XML output file and a plain text version:

    USAFEL-UchiTelle-small-out.xml
    USAFEL-UchiTelle-small-out.txt

## Support

Please submit bug reports and feature requests

    https://github.com/alexlancaster/pypop/issues

### Bug reporting

When reporting bugs, especially during installation, please run the following and include the output:

    echo $CPATH
    echo $LIBRARY_PATH
    echo $PATH

If you are running on MacOS please also run and include the output of:

    port installed
