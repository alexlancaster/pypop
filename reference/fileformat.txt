File format is plain ASCII, with fields delimited by tabstops, not
spaces.  Fields are separated by tabs so that spaces are permitted
within a field.

No field may be left blank.  Four asterisks should be used to designate
untyped locus data or unknown descriptive data.

There should be 3 lines of header information on a population file.

The fields are labelled on the first line as follows:

LINE 1:
labcode	method	ethnic	contin	collect	latit	longit	complex

Data under these headings are filled in on line 2 as follows:

LINE 2:
The method should be one of the following:
SSOP
RLS
SBT
SSP
RSCA
MS        (this is for PCR/gel sizing for microsatellites)
RFLP
SSCP
Other

The ethnic field may contain practically anything, but the contin field
should contain one of the following geographic regions:
North Africa
Sub-Saharan Africa
North-East Asia
South-East Asia
South-West Asia
Australia
Europe
North America
Oceania
South America
Other

The collect field is for where the data was collected, latit and longit are
for the latitude and longitude (approximately) of origin, and complex should
be entered as a zero.

There is one more line which contains the headers for the columns of genotype
data.
LINE 3:
populat id	a_1	a_2	c_1	c_2	b_1	b_2	tap1_1	tap1_2

populat should contain a name for the population and id should contain
a sample id.

There should be two header labels for each locus, giving the name of the locus,
in lower case please, followed by an underscore and a one or a two.

From here on down, the file should contain genotype data, all
tab-separated, with no blanks and a string of four asterisks indicating
untyped loci.  Homozygotes must be entered twice, otherwise they
cannot be differentiated from ambiguous typing results.

There should be no trailing blank lines at the end of a file.
