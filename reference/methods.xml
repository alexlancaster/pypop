      <title>Background</title>

      <formalpara>
	<title>1. Statistical Aspects of Genetics</title> 
	
	<para> Both parameter estimation and hypothesis testing are
	relevant.</para>
      </formalpara>

      <formalpara>
	<title>2. Simple rules of probability are sufficient for most probability calculations in genetics:</title>

	<para> the probability of both of two independent events
	is the product of their separate probabilities;  the
	probability of either of two mutually exclusive events is the
	sum of their separate probabilities. For example, the
	probability that a sibling of a child affected with a
	recessive trait will also be affected is the probability that
	both of the  parents transmit the variant
	allele.  If the two parents are both phenotypically
	normal, they must both be heterozygous. So, the probability of
	both transmitting the allele for the trait is ½ x ½ =
	¼.</para>
      </formalpara>

      <formalpara>
	<title>3.  Likelihood and Maximum Likelihood</title>
	
	<para>One important concept to distinguish from probability is
	likelihood.  Likelihood is the concept used to consider
	different hypotheses given a set of data.  The likelihood
	of a hypothesis given a set of data is defined as being
	proportional to the probability of the data given that
	hypothesis.</para>
      </formalpara>
      
      <para> L(hypothesis|data) is proportional to P(data|hypothesis)</para>

      <para>A likelihood ratio is defined as
      L(H<subscript>0</subscript>|D)/L(H<subscript>1</subscript>|D) =
      P(D|H<subscript>0</subscript>)/P(D|H<subscript>1</subscript>).  Thus,
      one can consider hypothesis 0 being more or less likely than
      hypothesis 1 given a set of data depending on whether the ratio
      is greater than 1 or less than 1.  This leads to the
      concept that the best hypothesis is the one that has the
      greatest likelihood, the one under which the observed data are
      the most probable.</para>

      <para>4.  Genotype:Phenotype relationships must be
      considered in all problems; the simplest qualitative ones
      (dominance, recessivity, co-dominance) may not apply if more
      than two alleles are present or more than one locus is involved
      in the phenotype.</para>

      <formalpara>
	<title>5.  Gene frequency in a population</title>

	<para>Given phenotypes for a sample of individuals from a
	population one wishes to estimate the frequency/frequencies of
	the alleles.  First, one needs to determine the
	relationships between genotypes and the observed
	phenotypes.  Let us assume co-dominance as is often (but
	not always) the case for molecular markers.  This equates
	to a 1:1 relationship between genotype and phenotype and
	common sense says that we can count the alleles in the sample
	and that the frequencies in the sample are our estimate of the
	frequencies in the population.  In fact, that gene
	counting estimate is the maximum likelihood
	estimate.  How can you demonstrate that?</para>
      </formalpara>

    <section>
      <title>Calculation of allele frequencies and heterozygosity</title>

      <para> Allele frequencies are generally calculated by gene
      counting assuming that each phenotype (what is seen: the
      laboratory typing result) is equivalent to a
      genotype.  These are used in the test for H-W
      ratios.</para> <para> The standard statistic to describe amount
      of variation is heterozygosity.  Why do we want to quantify
      the amount of variation?  There are several reasons, most
      of which involve statistical power that increases with
      heterozygosity.  For example, in linkage mapping studies in
      families researchers want markers that will be informative
      (=heterozygous) in most members of any family being
      studied.  The STRP markers with their large numbers of
      alleles are the markers of choice for this purpose.  In
      association studies researchers also want markers that are
      capable of subdividing the population into moderately large
      groups, but using markers with low mutation rates.  STRPs
      with their high mutation rates are not so useful, but SNPs are
      even though their maximum heterozygosity is 50%.  (Note,
      many recent papers on SNPs refer to the <quote>minor allele
      frequency</quote>.  This terminology is a neologism that
      should be avoided.  The word <emphasis>minor</emphasis>
      means <quote>less important</quote> NOT <quote>less
      frequent</quote>.  Use of heterozygosity as a statistic
      completely avoids this erroneous terminology.)</para>

      <para> Mathematically, heterozygosity is defined as the expected
      frequency of individuals that would be heterozygous in a large
      population given the allele frequencies for the
      population:</para>

      <para>  H=1-&#xf053;p<subscript>i</subscript><superscript>2</superscript></para>

      <para>The statistic applies to two-allele systems and to
      multi-allele systems since the
      p<subscript>i</subscript><superscript>2
       </superscript>represent the expected frequencies of
      homozygotes for each of the i alleles.</para>

  <title>Hardy-Weinberg</title>
  
  <sect2>
   <title>Introduction</title>
   
   <para condition="main;anthro-book">Mendelian genetics was
    rediscovered in the early 1900's. The Hardy-Weinberg law is the
    foundation of population genetics, and was derived independently
    in 1908 by an English mathematician Hardy and a German physician
    Weinberg.  R.C. Punnett brought to the attention of Hardy a remark
    of Yule (a geneticist)&mdash;Mr. Yule is reported to have
    suggested as a criticism of the Mendelian position that if
    brachydactyly (short fingeredness) is dominant <quote>in the
     course of time one would expect, in the absence of counteracting
     factors, to get 3 brachydactylous individuals to 1
     normal.</quote> Of course we now understand that Yule is
    confusing the Mendelian 3:1 ratio in an F1 cross (Aa x Aa gives
    3A-:1aa) with population features.</para>

   <para condition="main">Basically we want to consider whether or not
    Mendelian segregation causes changes in the genetic structure of a
    population. We want to consider the effect of this factor acting
    in isolation from all other possible factors, so we assume:</para>

     <para>infinite population size, i.e., the population size is so
      large that we can ignore small chance variations in allele
      frequencies, so we can predict exactly what the allele
      frequencies will be in a future generation, this is known as a
      deterministic model, e.g., the equivalent when a coin is tossed
      is that you would get exactly 50% heads and 50% tails, not a
      distribution of values as seen in reality with a finite sample
      size (stochastic model).</para></listitem>
   </orderedlist>

   <para>For a gene with <varname>k</varname> alleles, the expected
    frequency of each homozygote under Hardy Weinberg proportions
    (HWP) is
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>i</subscript><superscript>2</superscript> 
    and of each heterozygote is
    <varname>2p</varname><subscript>i</subscript><varname>p</varname><subscript>j</subscript> 
    for i &lt; j, i,j = 1,2,...,k</para>


   <para condition="main;anthro-book">The importance of the
    Hardy-Weinberg law is that if there are no counteracting forces,
    then the frequencies of alleles do not change in a population. In
    other words, variation in a population, under a Mendelian system,
    tends to be maintained. We contrast this to blending inheritance,
    a mechanism proposed before Mendel's rules were discovered, where
    genetic variation is decreased each generation. Further, the
    expected genotype frequencies each generation are determined by
    the allele frequencies, and are termed Hardy-Weinberg proportions
    (HWP). Continued random mating leads to the same genotype (and
    allele) frequencies, hence the term Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

     effect of chance variations for there ???</remark>  </para>

   <title>Hardy-Weinberg proportions (HWP)</title>
   
   <para> We consider initially a two allele system, but the results
    extend easily to multiple alleles. The two alleles are A and a
    with respective frequencies <varname>p</varname> and
    <varname>q</varname> (<varname>p</varname>+<varname>q</varname>=1,
    so note that we have only one independent variable). If gametes
    combine at random then the frequencies of the three genotypic
    classes in the next generation are:</para>

      </tbody>
     </tgroup>
    </informaltable>
   </para>

   <para>(Note that the 2 for the heterozygote class comes about since
    there are two ways a heterozygote can form, each with probability
    <varname>pq</varname>, the father can supply the A allele and the
    mother the a allele, or vice versa.) Using gene (allele) counting,
    with <varname>f(.)</varname> denoting frequency, such that
    <varname>f(A)</varname> = <varname>f(AA)</varname> +
    <varname>f(Aa)</varname>/2, and assuming we can distinguish the
    heterozygote from the two homozygote classes, we obtain,
    <varname>f(A)</varname> =
    <varname>p</varname><superscript>2</superscript> +
    <varname>pq</varname> = <varname>p(p + q)</varname> =
    <varname>p</varname>.</para>
   
   <para>Thus, we have demonstrated that under the assumptions of the
    Hardy-Weinberg law, the allele frequencies in the offspring
    generation are the same as those in the parental generation. This
    results from the fact that there are no forces operating to cause
    systematic change in allele frequencies, since the two alleles in
    this case are considered to be selectively equivalent (neutral
    with respect to each other). Further, it follows that in all
    subsequent generations, the genotypic distribution will remain
    <varname>p</varname><superscript>2</superscript>AA,
    2<varname>pq</varname>Aa,
    <varname>q</varname><superscript>2</superscript>aa. With
    overlapping generations, there is rapid convergence to the HWP.
    For a multi-allelic system, the results are exactly equivalent,
    with the expected homozygote genotype frequencies given by
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>i</subscript><superscript>2</superscript>, 
    where <varname>p</varname><subscript>i</subscript> is the allele
    frequency for the <varname>ith</varname> allele, and the expected
    heterozygote genotype frequencies are given by
    2<varname>p</varname><subscript>i</subscript>p<subscript>j</subscript>, 
    with <varname>i&lt;j</varname>. Although complicated in words, the
    Hardy Weinberg law is, statistically speaking, a simple statement
    about independence of allele frequencies at a locus.</para>

   <para>The strength of the Hardy-Weinberg law is that much of the
    variation in natural populations follows HWP; its weakness is that
    selection, etc., have to be very strong to detect deviations from
    HWP.</para>
  </sect2>
  
  <sect2>
   <title>Testing fit to HWP</title>
   
   <para condition="main;anthro-book">There are two important issues
    with regard to HWP testing. First is testing the overall fit of a
    sample. Traditionally, a large sample goodness-of-fit chi-square
    is performed when the number of genotypes is small relative to the
    sample size. With the development of modern molecular technology,
    the situation is often different from this. For instance, over 400
    alleles have been described at the HLA class I B locus, although
    not all these alleles are seen in any one population. However, it
    is not uncommon for researchers to distinguish more than a few
    dozen alleles in a reasonable-sized sample for the HLA class I and
    class II loci. Therefore, in many studies the genotypic matrix is
    relatively sparse and some simulation approaches, e.g. <citation
     role="citet">Guo:Thompson:1992</citation>, are more appropriate
    than their asymptotic counter parts in testing for overall fit of
    HWP.</para>

   <para condition="main;anthro-book">The second issue is testing at
    the individual heterozygote level. For a given sample, beside the
    overall fit, researchers are often interested in knowing which
    individual heterozygote or homozygote significantly deviates from
    its HW expectation, especially when the genotype matrix is
    relatively large. If one rejects the overall fit, which
    heterozygote(s) is/are responsible for the deviation? If one does
    not reject the overall fit, are there consistent and significant
    patterns of deviation at the individual level, which were not
    detected by an overall test?  This is especially relevant when
    genetic data are available from more than one population. By
    comparing patterns across populations, consistent deviations,
    which may not be strong enough to be found in the overall tests of
    an individual sample, could be detected. This will allow
    researchers to generate future hypothesis on the mechanisms
    causing such patterns and facilitate further study of this genetic
    region.</para>
   
   <sect3>
    <title>The chi-square test</title>
    
    <para condition="main;anthro-book">The basis of the chi-square
     test is to calculate expected genotype values based on HWP for
     individual genotype values and test for fit to HWP using an
     overall test. When expected genotype counts are &ge;5, calculate
     the individual chi-square value for this genotype, i.e.,
     <varname>(O-E)</varname><superscript>2</superscript>/<varname>E</varname>, 
     where <varname>O</varname> is observed and <varname>E</varname>
     is expected for that genotype, and add together the contributions
     of each genotype.</para>

    <para condition="main">If there are no rare genotypes (expected
     number &lt; 5), the degrees of freedom (d.f.)  for the overall
     chi-square test are given by <varname>k(k-1)</varname>/2, where
     <varname>k</varname> is the number of alleles in the sample under
     study. This comes from the formula, d.f. = number of categories -
     1 - number of independent parameters estimated from the data
     needed to determine the expected values (in this case
     <varname>k-1</varname>, since if we know <varname>k-1</varname>
     allele frequencies we can determine the <varname>kth</varname>
     allele frequency). Since the number of categories (genotypes) in
     this case is <varname>k</varname> (homozygotes) +
     <varname>k(k-1)</varname>/2 (heterozygotes) =
     <varname>k(k+1)</varname>/2, from which we subtract 1 (since
     given the frequencies of all except one of these categories we
     can always determine the frequency of the remaining category
     given the sample size), and subtract <varname>(k-1)</varname>
     (the number of independent allele frequencies need to estimate
     the HWP), to give the d.f. = <varname>k(k-1)</varname>/2.</para>
	  
    <para condition="main">As examples we consider a 2 allele case, as
     above, with a range of observed (O) genotype frequencies, all
     with <varname>p</varname> = 0.6, <varname>q</varname> = 0.4, and
     all with sample size <varname>N</varname> = 100 individuals. In
     all cases the expected (E) HWP genotype counts are 36, 48, and
     16. Next to the observed numbers in each case the <varname>(O -
      E)</varname> values are given. The d.f. = 1 in each case for the
     overall chi-square test. For a chi-square distribution with 1
     d.f., the cut-off points, i.e., rejection of the null hypothesis
     of fit to HWP are 3.84 (5%), 6.64 (1%), and 10.83 (0.1%). If the
     overall chi-square value is greater than one of these values,
     then the null hypothesis of overall fit to HWP for these
     genotypes is rejected with the type 1 error (probability you have
     made a mistake) given in parentheses.</para>

    <title>Exact tests</title>
    
    <para><citation role="citet">Levene:1949</citation> described the
     conditional sampling distribution for Hardy Weinberg populations.
     An algorithm for generating the exact distribution of samples
     drawn from a population in HWP was proposed by
     <citation role="citet">Louis:Dempster:1987</citation>. Using this
     algorithm, one could develop an exact test for HWP, analogous to
     Fisher's 2x2 exact test. This approach can be applied to an
     arbitrary number of alleles, especially when sample sizes are
     small. It provides a reliable alternative to the standard
     goodness of fit test and methods that require corrections. Below
     is an example of a test for deviations from HWP using such an
     exact test.</para>

    <para>Consider a sample of 40 individuals, where the genotype
     counts for a bi-allelic locus are: <varname>n(AA)</varname> = 5,
     <varname>n(Aa)</varname> = 9, and <varname>n(aa)</varname> = 26.
     The total count for each allele is: <varname>n(A)</varname> = 19
     , and <varname>n(a)</varname> = 61. Using the expression given by
     <citation role="citet">Levene:1949</citation> we compute the
     probability of obtaining this set of genotypes, conditional on
     the observed counts of alleles, under the null hypothesis of no
     association (i.e., HWP). The probability of this combination is
     0.0205</para>

    <para>The challenge now is to decide whether the probability
     associated to this outcome is particularly low. This can be done
     by comparing the probability of this specific genotypic
     combination with that of all other possible combinations. This is
     summarized in the table below. All genotypic possibilities,
     conditional on the observed number of alleles, are listed and
     sorted by their probabilities.</para>

    <para> However, with an increase in the number of alleles and
     sample size, the number of possible configurations of samples

     <citation>Metropolis:1953</citation>, where the transition
     probabilities between any two states were a function of the ratio
     of probabilities of being in each of them. The equilibrium
     distribution of the Markov chain was set to have the same allele
     frequencies as those in the observed sample and the HWP genotype
     probabilities. After a <quote>dememorization</quote> period, the

    <citation>Chen:etal:1999</citation> exact test of individual
    heterozygote deviations from HWP, have been applied to HLA class
    II genotype data in 26 populations
    <citation>Chen:etal:1999</citation>. Eighty of the 99 overall
    tests fitted HWP (73% for DRB1, 89% for DQA1, 81% for DQB1, and
    81% for DPB1), deviations were both locus and group specific. The
    individual test results indicated that the departure was partly
    due to recent admixture. Evidence for selection as a cause of
    deviation from HWP was also observed; the fact that the DQB1
    allele *0301 was involved in significant individual heterozygote
    deficiencies in eight samples could well implicate
    selection.</para>

   <para condition="main">In many cases the genotypes showing
    significant deviation contain alleles suspected of being the
    result of admixture or recent origin within the group. It is
    possible that admixture has effectively caused the deviation from
    HWP, suggesting its very recent history to the group, perhaps
    within one generation. Other explanations for the deviation from
    HWP, including non-random mating patterns with regard to admixed
    individuals within the ethnic group, must also be considered. On
    the other hand, significant deviations from HWP are also seen in
    populations which showed very little evidence for any admixture,
    e.g., the Mixe, an Amerindian group from Oaxaca, Mexico
    <citation>Hollenbach:etal:2001</citation>. These deviations could
    be due to the impact of selection pressures from infectious
    diseases on these genes. </para>

   <para condition="main;anthro-book"> Testing for fit to HWP can also
    serve a useful role in assessing the initial quality of typing
    results. Should deviations from expectations occur, it is possible
    to look again at the raw data and the methods employed to generate
    them, and if deemed necessary repeat typing and use alternative
    methods to confirm results. This may be particularly relevant for
    HLA typing in non-Caucasian populations, where new alleles which
    may not be detected by the typing system are more likely to
    occur.</para>

   <para condition="main;anthro-book"> Also, we have to caution here
    that the individual heterozygote testing approach is most useful
    if one has an a priori hypothesis about one or a few heterozygotes
    in the sample, regarding their excess or deficit from HWP. By
    applying the method to all heterozygotes, we face the problem of
    multiple tests, and some results merely reflecting type 1 error.
    Therefore any <varname>p</varname> values need to judged with
    care. However, the approach is still of general interest and
    validity in detecting patterns and generating future
    hypotheses.</para>

    <title>Measuring genetic variation among populations</title>

    <para>Genetic variation among populations is generally measured as
      F<subscript>st</subscript> = &#x3c3;
      <subscript>p</subscript><superscript>2</superscript>/p-bar
      q-bar, as noted in section II.B. The theory underlying this
      standardized variance derives from consideration of random
      genetic drift. Random genetic drift is simply the accumulated
      sampling error for transmission of alleles from generation to
      generation in a finite population. If there is no selection
      operating and a single population divides into two populations,
      both with the identical allele frequencies, the allele
      frequencies will gradually diverge over the generations if there
      is no migration (exchange of alleles) between them. This is
      easily measured as an increase in the variance in the frequency
      of an allele across the two (or more) diverging
      populations. With all populations starting at the same allele
      frequency, p<subscript>0</subscript>, and maintaining a constant
      population size, N, the variance at time t in generations of
      independent random genetic drift is expected to be</para>

    <para>as a measure of variation, which corresponds to F<subscript>st</subscript> in Wright's notation:</para>

    <para>f<subscript>t</subscript>  1 - <emphasis>e</emphasis><emphasis><superscript>-t/2N</superscript></emphasis></para>

    <para>The limiting value of f<subscript>t</subscript> (f) for
    <emphasis>t</emphasis> = infinity is 1 where all populations are
    fixed for one allele or the other.</para>

    <para><emphasis>N</emphasis> must be estimated as effective
    population size, not census size. It can be important to consider
    the effect of the sex ratio of reproducing individuals, which is
    sometimes different from 1:1. The harmonic mean of the numbers of
    reproducing animals in the two sexes,
    <emphasis>N</emphasis><emphasis><subscript>M</subscript></emphasis>
    and
    <emphasis>N</emphasis><emphasis><subscript>F</subscript></emphasis>,
    is used (Wright, 1931):</para>

    <para>1/N<subscript>h</subscript> = (1/N<subscript>M</subscript> + 1/N<subscript>F</subscript>)/2</para>

    <para>Twice the harmonic mean of males and females,
    <emphasis>2N</emphasis><emphasis><subscript>h</subscript></emphasis>,
    is the effective population size:</para>

    <para>N<subscript>e</subscript> = 4N<subscript>M</subscript>N<subscript>F</subscript>/(N<subscript>M</subscript> + N<subscript>F</subscript>)</para>

    <para>The variation on <emphasis>N</emphasis> over generations is also accounted for by taking harmonic means.</para>

    <para>Unbiased estimates of
    <emphasis>V</emphasis><emphasis><subscript>t</subscript></emphasis><subscript>
    </subscript>and of <emphasis>p</emphasis> do not necessarily give
    rise to an unbiased estimate of <emphasis>f</emphasis>. Moreover,
    the sampling properties of the static <emphasis>f</emphasis> are
    not known. An approximation that has frequently been used and is
    satisfactory when the average gene frequencies are between .05 and
    .95, is to use, instead of gene frequencies, their angular
    transforms:</para>

  <para>&#x3b8; = sin<superscript>-1</superscript>(sqrt p)</para>

    <para>This, unlike the bi-normal variate, <emphasis>p</emphasis>(1
    - <emphasis>p</emphasis>)/<emphasis>N</emphasis>, has variance
    independent of <emphasis>p</emphasis>:</para>

    <para>V<subscript>q</subscript> = 1/4N</para>

    <para>From this angular transform one can also derive an estimate
    of F<subscript>st</subscript>. Note, in Wright's notation the t
    does not relate to time but to the total population as though it
    were not subdivided (see below).</para>

    <para> These estimates of F<subscript>st</subscript> can be
    related to the underlying parameter of time in generations and
    effective population size as -ln (1 - F<subscript>st</subscript>)
     t/2N<subscript>e</subscript> (Kidd and Cavalli-Sforza,
    1974). Thus, divergence between populations increases with time
    but more slowly for larger population sizes. From this inverse
    relationship to population size one readily sees the basis for
    what is often referred to as "founder effect" or "bottleneck
    effect"  this is simply the same as random genetic drift but
    at the end of the scale of very small population sizes over a
    short time period. It is a quantitative phenomenon on a continuum
    and not a qualitatively different phenomenon.</para>

    <para>When populations are being studied for genetic
    similarity/difference, many different statistics based on gene
    frequency differences have been proposed but the most commonly
    used measures are based on estimates of
    F<subscript>st</subscript>. Reynolds et al. (1983) proposed an
    estimator of F<subscript>st</subscript> that has excellent
    statistical properties and can be applied to multiple loci with an
    arbitrary number of alleles.</para>

    <para>The F statistics of Wright (1921) (see, for example, a
    standard population genetics textbook such as Hartl and Clark,
    1997, for discussion) can be considered in different
    ways. Originally they were defined to quantify inbreeding in
    structured populations. Systematic inbreeding, say preferential
    mating of first or second cousins, will increase the proportion of
    homozygotes in the population over what would be expected in a
    randomly mating population as predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg
    ratios. Wright drew the analogy with sub-structured populations
    where the structuring imposes a level of inbreeding, albeit not
    among close relatives. His F statistics measure the decrease in
    heterozygosity (increase in homozygosity) in a level of the
    population hierarchy relative to the heterozygosity if there were
    random mating at the more inclusive level. Thus, the subscripts in
    F<subscript>st</subscript> refer to the reduction in
    heterozygosity in the <phrase

   <title>Homozygosity test of neutrality</title>
   
   <para>The neutral theory of evolution at a locus assumes that all
    alleles are selectively equivalent, that mutation is the source of
    new genetic variation, and that genetic drift results in loss of
    variation.  <citation role="citet">Ewens:1972</citation> developed
    a sampling theory that predicts the distribution of alleles at a
    locus drawn from a population at equilibrium under neutrality.
    <citation role="citet">Watterson:1978</citation> developed a
    method, using a homozygosity measure, denoted by
    <varname>F</varname>, for the observed number of alleles and
    sample size, to compare a sample of allele frequencies to
    neutrality expectations. For a given number of observed alleles, a
    low value of the homozygosity measure <varname>F</varname>,
    compared to the neutrality expectation, corresponds to all alleles
    having similar frequencies. Some form of balancing selection is
    implied when the observed allele frequencies are more even than
    the neutrality expectation <citation>Watterson:1978</citation>. A
    high value of <varname>F</varname>, compared to the neutrality
    expectation, corresponds to one allele predominating with the
    others at low frequencies. Directional selection is implicated in
    this case. Note that fit of a sample of allele frequencies to
    neutrality expectations does not mean that selection is not
    operating, but simply that one cannot reject the neutral
    model.</para>

   <para> The observed frequency distribution of alleles in a
    population is compared to neutrality expectations under an
    infinite alleles model. The expected proportion of homozygotes
    under Hardy-Weinberg, i.e., the statistic <varname>F</varname> =

    <citation role="citet">Watterson:1978</citation> for an observed

    (2<varname>n</varname> chromosomes), was compared with the
    distribution expected under the neutral model
    <citation>Ewens:1972</citation>. Note that the Watterson
    homozygosity test of neutrality does not examine deviations from
    Hardy-Weinberg proportions, but utilizes the expected
    Hardy-Weinberg homozygosity as a measure of the distribution of
    allelic frequencies, for a given sample size
    (<varname>k</varname>) and observed number of alleles
    (2<varname>n</varname>). The expected values of
    <varname>F</varname>, and the variance and quantiles under the

   <title>Application of Ewens-Watterson test of neutrality to HLA

<!--   
   <para> Allele frequencies within a population for serologically
    typed HLA class I A, B, and C and the class II DR locus, and for
    molecularly typed class II DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1, are often more
    even than expected under neutrality, suggesting that some form of
    balancing selection is operating on these genes (
   <citation>Hedrick:Thomson:1983</citation>, Klitz et al. 1986, 1992, 
   Begovich et al. 1992). In
   contrast, the distribution of DPB1 alleles rarely differs

   <para condition="main">In contrast to the allele level variation,
    at the amino acid level all 4 class II (DRB1, DQB1, DQA1, DPB1)
    loci showed evidence of balancing selection at many polymorphic
    codon sites, and consistently so across diverse populations.
    However, directional selection was seen for a few sites, and
    neutrality profiles were exhibited by other codons (<citation
     role="citet">Salamon:etal:1999</citation>; <citation
    role="citet">Valdes:etal:1999</citation>). Cases of amino acid
    variation showing balancing selection occurred at sites both
    within the highly polymorphic antigen recognition site (ARS) and
    outside it. Only for DRB1 was there evidence of more balancing
    selection for ARS sites compared to non-ARS sites. As the
    determination of DQ and DP ARS sites is based on theoretical
    models in lieu of the crystal structure, it is possible that many
    of the sites designated as non-ARS may actually be involved in
    antigen presentation. It is of particular interest in this context
    that two non-ARS sites identified as highly polymorphic and
    showing balancing selection (DQA1#47 and DQB1#26) have also been
    identified as amino acids involved in predisposition to type 1

  <title>Measuring non-randomness of alleles on chromosomes</title>
      
  <para>The description of genetic variation at the population level
   usually begins with consideration of allelic variation at a single
   gene locus, as discussed above.  The next step is to consider
   genetic variation at two or more loci simultaneously, including
   non-random associations.  Gametic disequilibrium (usually referred
   to as linkage disequilibrium, LD) describes the non-random
   association of alleles at different genetic loci.  While linkage
   disequilibrium can be more generally referred to as <quote>gametic
   phase disequilibrium</quote>, or, in other words, the non-random
   occurrence in gametes of alleles at two or more loci, in general it
   is immaterial whether the two loci are linked.  In practice, and in
   almost all of the literature today, it is used only for linked
   loci.  Thus, it can also be defined as the non-random occurrence on
   chromosomes in the population of alleles at two or more
   loci.</para>

  <sect2>
   
   <title>Tests for linkage disequilibrium and its statistical
    significance</title>

   <para> One can estimate the frequencies of haplotypes in a
    population and then measure the amount of non-randomness.  It is
    important to distinguish the existence of non-randomness from
    specific statistics used to measure that non-randomness.  There
    are several different statistics in use today and considerable
    debate about which is <quote>correct</quote>.  The classic
    pairwise gametic disequilibrium parameter, usually denoted D, is
    given by the difference between the observed frequency of a
    gametic type and the frequency expected on the basis of random
    association of alleles in gametes.  Consider two genes (denoted
    <emphasis>A</emphasis> and <emphasis>B</emphasis>), with two
    alleles each (A, a and B, b), and four gametic types (also
    referred to as haplotypes): AB, Ab, aB, and ab.  The frequencies
    of the four gametes (denoted <varname>f(AB)</varname> etc.) can be
    described in terms of the allele frequencies
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>A</subscript>
    (<varname>p</varname><subscript>a</subscript>= 1 -
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>A</subscript>) and
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>B</subscript>
    (<varname>p</varname><subscript>b</subscript> = 1 -
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>B</subscript>) at the two loci, and
    the gametic disequilibrium parameter <varname>D</varname>, as
    follows:</para>

   <para><varname>f(AB)</varname> = <varname>p</varname><subscript>A</subscript> <varname>p</varname><subscript>B</subscript> + <varname>D</varname>,</para>
   <para><varname>f(Ab)</varname> = <varname>p</varname><subscript>A</subscript> <varname>p</varname><subscript>b</subscript> - <varname>D</varname>,</para>
   <para><varname>f(aB)</varname> = <varname>p</varname><subscript>a</subscript> <varname>p</varname><subscript>B</subscript> - <varname>D</varname>,</para>
   <para><varname>f(ab)</varname> = <varname>p</varname><subscript>a</subscript> <varname>p</varname><subscript>b</subscript> + <varname>D</varname>,</para>
   
   <para>where <varname>D</varname> = <varname>f(AB)</varname> - <varname>p</varname><subscript>A</subscript>
   <varname>p</varname><subscript>B</subscript> = <varname>f(AB)</varname> <varname>f(ab)</varname> - <varname>f(Ab)</varname> <varname>f(aB)</varname>.</para>

   <para>D can be either positive or negative, depending on which
    specific alleles are referenced.  If <varname>D</varname> = 0 (a
    state referred to as gametic or linkage equilibrium) then the
    alleles at the two loci are randomly associated.  If
    <varname>D</varname> &gt; 0 the allele A occurs more often with
    allele B than expected by chance (and hence a with b), while if
    <varname>D</varname> &lt; 0 alleles A and b (and hence a and B)
    are preferentially associated.  The possible value of
    <varname>D</varname> in a two-locus system is constrained by the
    fact that the frequency of any haplotype is constrained as:</para>

   <para>0 &le; <varname>f(AB)</varname>&le;
    min(<varname>p</varname><subscript>A ,
    </subscript><varname>p</varname><subscript>B</subscript>)</para>

   <para>and thus the disequilibrium coefficient is constrained
    by:</para>

   <para>-<varname>p</varname><subscript>a</subscript><varname>p</varname><subscript>b</subscript>, 
    -<varname>p</varname><subscript>A</subscript><varname>p</varname><subscript>B</subscript> 
    &le; <varname>D</varname><subscript>AB</subscript> &le;
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>A</subscript><varname>p</varname><subscript>b</subscript>, 
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>a</subscript><varname>p</varname><subscript>B</subscript>.</para>

   <para>Consequently, interpretation of <varname>D</varname> values
    is dependent on the allele frequencies. To avoid this, the
    normalized gametic disequilibrium
    <varname>D</varname><superscript>&prime;</superscript> =
    <varname>D</varname>/<varname>D</varname><subscript>max</subscript> 
    is often considered, where
    <varname>D</varname><subscript>max</subscript> is equal to either
    the lesser of <varname>p</varname><subscript>A</subscript>
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>b</subscript> or
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>a</subscript>
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>B</subscript> if
    <varname>D</varname> is positive, and the lesser of
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>A</subscript>
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>B</subscript> or
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>a</subscript>
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>b</subscript> if
    <varname>D</varname> is negative
    <citation>Lewontin:1964</citation>. The advantage of this measure
    over <varname>D</varname> is that it has a range from -1 to +1,
    regardless of the allele frequencies. Unfortunately, for both
    <varname>D</varname> and
    <varname>D</varname><superscript>&prime;</superscript> the values
    are not related to statistical significance and are dependent on
    allele frequencies. Therefore, several other measures are also
    being used: &delta;, &Delta; = <varname>r</varname>,
    <varname>r</varname><superscript>2</superscript>,
    <varname>d</varname><superscript>2</superscript>. These are
    reviewed by <citation
     role="citet">Devlin:Risch:1995</citation> except for
    <varname>d</varname><superscript>2</superscript>, used by
    <citation role="citet">Kruglyak:1999</citation>, which is closely
    related to <varname>D</varname><superscript>2</superscript> and to
    <varname>r</varname><superscript>2</superscript>:
    <varname>d</varname><superscript>2</superscript> =
    <varname>D</varname><superscript>2 </superscript>/
    [<varname>f(1-f)</varname>]<superscript>2 </superscript>and
    <varname>d</varname><superscript>2</superscript> =
    <varname>r</varname><superscript>2</superscript>
    <varname>m(1-m)</varname> /
    [<varname>f(1-f)</varname>]<superscript>2</superscript> , where
    <varname>f</varname> is the variant frequency and
    <varname>m</varname> is the marker allele frequency. Note, this is
    referenced to the locus of the <quote>variant</quote>. The correlation
    coefficient, <varname>r</varname> = <varname>D</varname> /
    (<varname>p</varname><subscript>A</subscript>
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>a</subscript>
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>B</subscript>
    <varname>p</varname><subscript>b</subscript>)<superscript>&half;</superscript>, 
    with a range from -1 to +1, is often used, as well as
    <varname>r</varname><superscript>2</superscript> with a range from
    0 to +1. An example from the HLA region is the association between
    alleles at the A, B and DR loci. The combinations A1-B8 and B8-DR3
    have fairly high normalized disequilibrium values
    (<varname>D</varname><superscript>&prime;</superscript> = 0.65 and
    <varname>D</varname><superscript>&prime;</superscript> = 0.73,
    respectively).</para>

   <para>There is a relationship between <varname>D</varname> and the
    recombination fraction <varname>c</varname> between two loci.
    (Various symbols are used for the recombination fraction; the most
    common symbol in human genetics is &thetas;.)  In the absence of
    drift and selection, changes in gamete frequencies over
    generations only occur by recombination in individuals
    heterozygous at both loci under consideration. In fact, the value
    of <varname>D</varname> decreases by a fraction
    <varname>(1-c)</varname> each generation under random mating and a
    neutral model.  Thus the LD in this case converges to zero (random
    association of alleles) with time as
    <varname>(1-c)</varname><superscript>n</superscript>, where
    <varname>n</varname> is the number of generations.  The more
    loosely linked are two loci, the faster the decay of linkage
    disequilibrium.  On the other hand, for very tightly linked loci
    gametic disequilibrium may exist for a very long time.</para>

   <para>It is possible, although relatively rare, that unlinked loci
    can be in significant LD, and that very closely linked loci may be
    in linkage (gametic) equilibrium. The value of LD is often
    expected to change each generation. Further, a population at
    genetic equilibrium can have significant LD (e.g., under various
    selection schemes). The term <emphasis>linkage
    disequilibrium</emphasis> is thus an unfortunate choice and the
    term <emphasis>gametic disequilibrium</emphasis> is preferable,
    although also not perfect.  However, the term <emphasis>linkage
    disequilibrium</emphasis> is commonly used and simply abbreviated
    LD.  There are two important points to remember: (1) that tight
    linkage or molecular proximity does not automatically mean there
    will be LD, and (2) that unlinked loci can show LD, for a variety
    of reasons.</para>

   <para condition="main">Linkage disequilibrium can occur in
    populations as a consequence of a number of factors <citation
    role="citep[for review, see][]">Hedrick:Thomson:1983</citation>: (1)
    mutation&ndash;when a new mutant arises, it occurs in one
    individual and is in linkage disequilibrium with all polymorphic
    loci in the population; (2) selection&ndash;either acting directly
    on the two loci, or transient linkage disequilibrium can also be
    created with neutral loci via a hitchhiking event with a selected
    locus <citation>Thomson:1977</citation>; (3) migration or
    admixture&ndash;generation of linkage disequilibrium by these
    forces requires that the allelic frequencies of both loci in the
    two populations be different, and this difference must be
    substantial to generate very much linkage disequilibrium; and (4)
    random genetic drift&ndash;while the expected value of pairwise
    linkage disequilibrium due to drift over many generations is zero,
    the variance is large for closely linked loci in small
    populations.</para>

   <para condition="main">The amount of linkage disequilibrium
    observed in a population is also affected by a number of factors:
    (1) recombination&ndash;significant linkage disequilibrium may be
    maintained for a long time between very closely linked loci; (2)
    selection&ndash;if the selection is sufficiently strong compared
    to the recombination rate linkage disequilibrium can be maintained
    at an equilibrium state, and will occur transiently with a
    hitchhiking event; (3) non-random mating&ndash;high levels of
    inbreeding and self-fertilization in plants can retard the rate of
    approach to linkage equilibrium; and (4) population
    demographics&ndash;a small founder population or a bottleneck in
    the recent past can cause significant linkage disequilibrium due
    to genetic drift for closely linked loci, and while less linkage
    disequilibrium will be generated by genetic drift in a rapidly
    growing population <citation>Slatkin:1994</citation>, any linkage
    disequilibrium present before or during the early phase of the
    expansion will persist.  </para>

<!--
   <remark>Keep this section??  As seen in Section II, the pattern of
    LD at many loci argues that human populations in sub-Saharan
    Africa have little LD beyond a few kb while all non-African
    populations tend to have much more LD and to share the same
    haplotypes.  Thus the evidence argues that most LD in non-African
    populations was produced by a founder effect (a very large amount
    of random genetic drift caused by a quite small population size)
    associated with the expansion of modern humans out of
    Africa.</remark>
-->

   <para>The definition of LD is <quote>easily</quote> extended to
    accommodate more than two alleles at a locus or more than two
    loci: non-randomness on chromosomes in the population across
    however many loci and/or among however many alleles.  However,
    statistics to quantify LD become more problematic in such cases.
    All of the above are defined for a pair of specified alleles at a
    pair of loci.  For multi-allelic loci, one must choose one allele
    at each locus and then pool all other alleles.  This gives
    <varname>n</varname><subscript>1</subscript> x
    <varname>n</varname><subscript>2</subscript> different pairwise
    measures for two loci with
    <varname>n</varname><subscript>1</subscript> and
    <varname>n</varname><subscript>2</subscript> alleles,
    respectively.  Interpreting such a set of LD statistics is not
    simple or obvious.  When considering three or more loci, higher
    order disequilibrium terms are also needed (see
    <citation>Robinson:etal:1991</citation>).  For example, in a
    three-locus system a gametic frequency can be expressed in terms
    of the three-allele frequencies, the three pairwise gametic
    disequilibria, and a single measure of third order gametic
    disequilibrium.  However, when multi-allelic loci are included or
    multiple (&gt;3) sites are included, the pairwise values and the
    higher order disequilibrium terms become difficult to interpret.
    Many papers now present data for multiple sites in a haplotype as
    all possible pairwise comparisons.  </para>

   <para>To date only one measure attempts to measure non-randomness
    in a general manner for an arbitrary number of sites with an
    arbitrary number of alleles at each: the permutation test based
    &#x3be; (Zhao et al., 1999).  While that measure has not been
    generally used by researchers studying LD in humans, it
    illustrates the distinction between the pairwise measures and the
    general concept of non-randomness of alleles on chromosomes in a
    population.</para>

   <para condition="main">General population level observations are
    that there is an overall proportionality between linkage
    disequilibrium and the inverse of the recombination distance
    (<citation>Huttley:etal:1999</citation>.  This rule however breaks
    down in very closely linked regions
    (<citation>Reich:etal:2001</citation>,
    <citation>Huttley:etal:1999</citation>,
    <citation>Jorde:etal:1994</citation>,
    <citation>Klitz:etal:1995</citation>). Selection is expected to
    produce linkage disequilibrium non-randomly across the genome,
    whereas all the other factors should act randomly over the genome.
    In study of the CEPH families, linkage disequilibrium was found to
    be non-randomly distributed throughout the genome
    <citation>Huttley:etal:1999</citation>.  Some regions, such as
    HLA, showed strong evidence of selection and significant linkage
    disequilibrium which spanned 3 cM or more, and an additional 10
    genetic regions showed linkage disequilibrium equal to or greater
    than in the HLA region.  Most recently, a series of papers in the
    October 2001 <citetitle>Nature Genetics</citetitle>
    <citation>Daly:etal:2001</citation> present evidence that LD in
    humans exists in blocks of strong LD separated by short intervals
    across which all LD breaks down.  Recombination hot spots and cold
    spots is one possible explanation for such a pattern.  How general
    around the genome this pattern is remains to be seen.</para>

   <title>Haplotype estimation on population and patient data sets</title>
   
   <para>The accuracy of haplotype estimates is of increasing interest
    with regard to population data and disease association studies,
    for microsatellite, SNP, and protein level variation.
    Marker-disease associations that are not detected at the single
    locus level, may nevertheless be detected in a multi-locus
    analysis.  This was the initial observation in the study of ch.
    19q13.2 APOE region variation and multiple sclerosis (<citation role="citealt">Barcellos:1996</citation>, <citation
     role="citealt">Barcellos:etal:1997a</citation> and
    <citation role="citealt">Barcellos:etal:1997b</citation>), and in analysis of
    ch. 19 markers and alcohol dependence
    <citation>Valdes:etal:1999</citation>.</para>
   
   <para>Procedures that make use of the expectation-maximization (EM)
    algorithm to estimate haplotype frequencies (HFs) from unphased
    genotype data are in common use in genetic studies, e.g.,
    <application>HAUPT</application>
    <citation>Baur:Danilovs:1980</citation>),
    <application>Arlequin</application>
    <citation>Schneider:etal:2000</citation>,
    <application>HAPLO</application>
    <citation>Hawley:Kidd:1995</citation>, and
    <application>3LOCUS.PAS</application>
    <citation>Long:etal:1995</citation>.  The EM algorithm uses these
    unphased genotype frequencies along with the assumption of
    Hardy-Weinberg proportions (HWP) to converge on HF estimates.  The
    EM algorithm is an iterative algorithm for computing maximum
    likelihood estimates (MLEs) in an incomplete-data setting
    (<citation role="citet">Dempster:1977</citation>;
    <citation>Lange:1997</citation>). The algorithm is
    straightforward.  Each iteration consists of two steps.  The
    E-step calculates the conditional expectation, and the M-step
    maximizes the updated likelihood function. Although the
    convergence of the EM algorithm could be slow, the general theory
    has shown that each iteration increases the likelihood and the
    MLEs are generally achieved <citation>Dempster:1977</citation>.
    The accuracy of haplotype frequency estimates are in general
    relatively good, except in the case of low frequency haplotypes
    (see e.g., <citation role="citealt">Schipper:etal:1998</citation>,
    <citation role="citealt">Fallin:Schork:2000</citation>, <citation
     role="citealt">Tishkoff:etal:2000</citation>, 
    <citation role="citealt">Single:etal:2002</citation>).  Large over
    and under estimates of particular HFs can occur even for common
    haplotypes, especially when the loci involved deviate
    significantly from HWP
    <citation>Single:etal:2002</citation>. Estimating HFs for three or
    more loci and then collapsing over loci so as to generate two
    locus haplotypes can improve the accuracy of the estimation. The
    collapsing procedure is most beneficial when one of the loci in
    the two-locus haplotype of interest deviates significantly from
    HWP and the locus collapsed over is in linkage disequilibrium with
    the other loci

   </figure>
   
   <para>The performance of the EM algorithm for the estimation of
    haplotypes in the HLA region is illustrated in <xref
    linkend="em-performance"/>These are results from a study reported
    in <citation role="citet">Single:etal:2002</citation> where family
    data allowed haplotypes to be unambiguously inferred, so true and
    estimated haplotype frequencies could be compared.  The graphs
    depict the performance of the EM algorithm in inferring two-locus
    haplotypes for selected pairs of sites.  The circles represent
    true haplotype frequencies, and the lines represent estimated
    haplotype frequencies. Two-locus haplotypes for the DPB1 and A
    loci offer an example of how pairs of loci between which there is
    little LD allow only poor estimates of haplotype frequencies:
    notice the large discrepancies between true (circles) and inferred
    (lines) frequencies.  In addition, note how for the DPB1-A
    haplotypes there are instances of missed haplotypes (true
    haplotypes not inferred - represented by circles with no lines)
    and incorrect haplotypes (inferred but not real - represented by
    lines with no circle).  The locus pair DQB1-DRB1 exemplifies
    completely accurate inference.  This results from the high LD
    values between these tightly linked loci. Finally, an intermediate
    scenario is exemplified by the inference of frequencies for the
    DQB1-B haplotype.</para>

   <para>The performance of the EM algorithm also differs depending on
    the true frequency of the haplotypes being estimated.  The table
    below compares the true and estimated haplotype sets using a
    measure that takes into account the frequency differences among
    observed and inferred haplotypes (the If measure, see
    <citation role="citealt">Single:etal:2002</citation>).  High
    values imply poor estimates (maximum being 1) and low values imply
    accurate estimates (minimum being 0).  Notice that with haplotypes
    that are present as a single copy (column 1), the estimation is
    very inaccurate, but improves as the true frequency increases.
    The haplotypes present as 4 or more copies are estimated most
    accurately.  This confirms the intuition that low frequency
    haplotypes are difficult to infer using the EM algorithm.  A
    similar result was obtained by
    <citation role="citet">Tishkoff:etal:2000</citation>.</para>

   <title>Testing for significance of linkage disequilibrium in a
    likelihood framework</title>
   
   <para>Two approaches can be used to quantify and test linkage
    disequilibrium (LD).  The first consists of using known haplotype
    frequencies to obtain LD values.  Overall measures of LD, which
    account for deviations from random association among all pairs of
    alleles at two loci, can be used to generate test statistics that
    can be tested using parametric tests.  For example, the overall
    measure of LD, <varname>Q</varname> (discussed in <citation
     role="citealt">Hedrick:1987</citation>) follows a chi-square
    distribution with <varname>(k-1)(l-1)</varname> degrees of freedom
    for datasets under linkage equilibrium (where <varname>k</varname>
    and <varname>l</varname> are the number of alleles at the first
    and second locus, respectively).  However, if haplotypes are
    inferred from unphased genotype data this approach is limited in
    that the uncertainty inherent in the haplotype estimation is not
    accounted for when LD values are estimated and tested.  The
    following likelihood-based approach circumvents this limitation.
   </para>

   <para>Two likelihood values are defined: L<subscript>1</subscript>
    is the likelihood of observed genotypic data given the estimated
    haplotype set (this is the likelihood value obtained using the EM
    algorithm). <varname>L</varname><subscript>0</subscript> is the
    likelihood of the observed data given haplotype frequencies
    expected under complete equilibrium (i.e. haplotype frequencies
    are given by the product of allele frequencies at each locus). The
    test-statistic is defined as:
   </para>

   <para><varname>S</varname> =
    -2log(<varname>L</varname><subscript>0</subscript>/<varname>L</varname><subscript>1</subscript>)</para>

   <para>The significance (p-value) of the observed test statistic can
    be obtained from a permutation test.  The logic behind a
    permutation test for the significance of linkage disequilibrium is
    that under the null hypothesis of no disequilibrium any genotype
    at one site is going to occur with any genotype at another site
    with the frequency equal to the product of those genotype
    frequencies.  Thus, by randomly permuting the observed genotypes
    at the separate sites among the individuals in the sample, the
    marginal allele frequencies (and genotype frequencies) are
    unaltered, but the new genotype combinations for the individuals
    in the sample are one realization under the null hypothesis.  By
    generating many such permuted datasets and evaluating each dataset
    by whatever statistic is being used, one generates a distribution
    of the statistic under the null hypothesis.  The statistic for the
    observed data can then be compared to the distribution and the
    significance is the fraction of the permuted datasets with a
    statistic greater than the observed.  As stated above, the
    statistic we use is the likelihood ratio for the observed data
    with the estimated haplotype frequencies compared to with
    equilibrium haplotype frequencies.</para>

   <para>An example is provided in <xref linkend="lr-stat-null"/>,
    where the distribution of <varname>S</varname> for a sample of
    Filipino individuals for haplotypes involving the DQB1 and DPA1
    loci.  The observed value of <varname>S</varname> is indicated by
    an arrow, showing that the probability of obtaining a value of
    <varname>S</varname> as extreme as that observed is 0.001 under
    the null hypothesis (no association between loci). Thus we reject
    the null hypothesis.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para> The genetic and physical maps, and technologies for gene
      identification that have already emerged from the Human Genome
      Project (HGP) have had a tremendous impact on the research
      community's ability to discover the genes that underlie human
      genetic variation (Collins et al. 1997, Gelerhter et al. 1998,
      Thomson 2001a). Recent successes in the genetic mapping of
      Mendelian traits and diseases have been remarkable. However,
      progress has been exceedingly slow in elucidating the genetic
      components of complex diseases and traits, such as
      cardiovascular diseases, asthma, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis,
      obesity, alcoholism, and schizophrenia. Complex diseases involve
      multiple genes, environmental effects, and their
      interactions. Rather than being due to specific and relatively
      rare mutations, complex diseases and traits may result
      principally from genetic variation that is relatively common in
      the general population. Examples include apolipoprotein E gene
      (<emphasis>APOE</emphasis>) variation and age of onset of
      Alzheimers disease, the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene
      (<emphasis>ACE</emphasis>) and myocardial infarction, the
      chemokine receptor CCR5 gene (<emphasis>CMKBR5</emphasis>) and
      the risk of infection in those exposed to HIV, and the many
      diseases for which immune response genes of the HLA region have
      been implicated.</para>

      <para>Diseases or traits caused by a single major gene or
      biochemical pathway defect are referred to as Mendelian, or
      single gene traits. Complicating factors such as incomplete
      penetrance&mdash;not all genetically predisposed individuals
      manifest the disease, as in polydactyly, and variable age of
      onset effects, as in Huntington disease, are often
      present. However, the basic single gene nature of the
      inheritance pattern is often evident, with Mendelian segregation
      patterns according to recessive, dominant, or sex chromosome
      X-linked inheritance (see Gelehrter et al. 1998 for review). A
      Mendelian disease can have complex clinical effects, e. g.,
      sickle cell anemia affects many organ systems. Even with the
      same allelic mutation, as in individuals with sickle cell
      anemia, there may be considerable variation in disease severity,
      due to modifier genes. The majority of Mendelian traits also
      show allele and/or locus heterogeneity. Different alleles at one
      gene may give rise to disease, e.g., cystic fibrosis, and result
      in variation in the disease expression. Different genes may also
      be responsible for disease in different families, e.g., the
      BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and early onset familial breast
      cancer.</para>

      <para> In contrast to Mendelian diseases, complex, or
      multi-factorial diseases are generally more common, and result
      from the interaction of multiple genes and environmental
      factors. Studies of rates of occurrence of disease in twins and
      other family members compared to population level rates are used
      to demonstrate the role of genetic and environmental factors in
      complex diseases. Genetically complex diseases may exhibit the
      following properties: incomplete penetrance &mdash;not all
      susceptible individuals are affected; the involvement of several
      disease-predisposing loci&mdash;some of which may have a major
      effect, but many of which may have a relatively minor effect;
      interaction effects between these loci and with environmental
      factors; and heterogeneity&mdash;so that different loci and/or
      alleles cause disease in different groups. As a result it is
      difficult with complex diseases to: localize disease genes;
      ascertain the number and relationship of disease loci involved;
      understand modes of inheritance and interaction effects;
      determine the molecular basis of disease; and understand the
      mechanism(s) by which these genetic changes give rise to
      disease, including all genetic and environmental factors and
      their interactions.</para>

      <para> The distinction in terminology between Mendelian and
      complex traits is not meant to imply that the genes underlying
      complex diseases do not follow the rules of Mendelian
      inheritance, but merely that a simple pattern of inheritance is
      not obvious. While the boundary between these two categories is
      not precisely defined, a large number of diseases clearly fall
      into each category. It is important to also remember that
      although we often use the shorthand notation of disease gene, or
      disease-causing gene, we are talking about variation at genes
      involved in normal human health and development, specific
      variations of which may lead to a disease state (Thomson and
      Esposito 1999).</para>

      <para> Sir Archibald Garrod's brilliant studies in 1908 of the
      genetics and biochemical pathways involved in <quote>inborn
      errors of metabolism.</quote> laid the conceptual foundation for
      all later studies in human genetics (Gelehrter et al. 1998). The
      single gene Mendelian nature of a large number of traits and
      diseases was subsequently identified. Gene mapping in humans
      before the 1970s was however essentially limited to the X
      chromosome, based on the specific pattern of inheritance. Future
      progress in biochemical genetics and gene mapping awaited
      advances in molecular biology.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Mapping genes involved in disease</title>
      
      <para>There are three main approaches to mapping the genetic
      variants involved in a disease: functional cloning, the
      candidate gene strategy, and positional cloning (Gelehrter et
      al. 1998). In functional cloning, identification of the
      underlying protein defect leads to localization of the
      responsible gene
      (disease&mdash;function&mdash;gene&mdash;map). Sickle cell
      anemia was the first human disease to be successfully understood
      at the molecular level and isolation of the mutant molecule led
      to the localization of the &beta;-globin gene on chromosome
      11. Functional cloning is, however, only useful in a subset of
      Mendelian traits where the biological basis is known, and in
      very few complex traits.</para>

      <para> In the candidate gene approach, genes with a known or
      proposed function with the potential to influence the disease
      phenotype are investigated for a direct role in disease
      (Gelehrter et al. 1998). The most successful application of the
      candidate gene approach to mapping complex diseases in humans
      has been with the HLA region on chromosome 6p21, the major
      histocompatibility complex of humans (see Section II.C
      above). Genes in the HLA region have been implicated in the
      etiology of over 200 diseases (Thorsby 1997).</para>

      <para>Positional cloning is used when the biochemical nature of
      a disease is unknown. Marker genes not related to disease
      physiology and genome-wide screens are then the starting point
      for mapping the genetic components of the disease. The aim is
      first to identify the genetic region within which a
      disease-predisposing gene lies and, once this is found, to
      localize the gene and determine its functional and biological
      role in the disease
      (disease&#x2192;map&#x2192;gene&#x2192;function). Most markers
      used nowadays are DNA based, (see Section I above).</para>

      <para>Landmarks in positional cloning have included genetic
      linkage of Huntington disease in 1983 to an RFLP (restriction
      fragment length polymorphism) marker (see section I above) on
      chromosome 4 (the gene was cloned in 1993) and the cloning of
      the cystic fibrosis gene on chromosome 7 in 1989. By 1990, when
      the HGP began, a handful of additional successes had accrued. In
      1994, the early onset familial breast/ovarian cancer (BRCA1)
      gene was cloned, and the early onset familial breast cancer
      (BRCA2) gene in 1995. By 1997 close to 100 Mendelian disease
      loci had been identified by positional cloning (Collins et
      al. 1997, Gelehrter et al. 1998). More are identified every
      month.</para>

      <para>A complementary array of approaches is available to
      uncover the different genetic facets of both Mendelian and
      complex traits and diseases (Lander and Schork 1994). Two
      complementary analytic methods, linkage analyses and association
      (linkage disequilibrium) mapping (see Sections 3 and 4 below),
      are used to detect the specific genetic regions and genes
      involved in the disease process. These approaches can be applied
      without prior knowledge of the biological basis of the disease
      using genome-wide studies, together with the candidate gene
      approach and comparative analyses using animal models of
      disease.</para>

      <para>While completion of a working draft of the human genome in
      the year 2000 has greatly aided studies of Mendelian and complex
      diseases, it does not provide an immediate solution to their
      genetics, especially for complex diseases. We must first address
      the daunting prospect of documenting the genetic variation of
      human genomes at the population level within and across ethnic
      groups. Only then, correlating this extensive genetic variation
      with disease, can we uncover the complete genetics of complex
      diseases and traits, and determine the environmental factors
      impacting on each disease (Thomson and Esposito 1999, Thomson
      2001a).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Linkage mapping</title>
      
      <section>
	<title>Linkage analyses</title> 

	<para> Linkage analyses test for co-segregation of a marker
	and disease phenotype within a pedigree (implicating physical
	linkage between the marker gene and a gene involved in the
	disease process, and such loci are then said to be
	<quote>linked</quote>) (Ott 1999). Linkage analyses do not
	require linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the marker and
	disease loci. Different marker alleles may segregate with
	disease in each pedigree.</para>

	<para> Linkage analyses can be performed using single marker
	locus variation, and any kind of inherited difference can
	potentially be a genetic marker. For genome-wide linkage
	analyses, testing for co-segregation with disease of about
	300-400 highly polymorphic markers, usually microsatellites,
	distributed approximately evenly over the genome (average
	spacing between markers is then on the order of 10cM, i.e.,
	10% recombination) is the usual practice. The increasing
	availability of more markers across the genome, combined with
	multi-point analyses using a number of closely linked markers,
	such as microsatellites and SNPs&mdash;hence increasing the
	informativeness with respect to co-segregation, will increase
	the power of linkage studies.</para>

	<para>When large multi-generation pedigrees are available,
	linkage analysis is a powerful technique for localizing
	disease genes and has been successfully applied to a number of
	monogenic traits, e.g., Huntington disease, and the familial
	breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. With diabetes, it has
	been used to map MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the young)
	genes. The occurrence of multiple alleles at one genetic locus
	involved in disease, as in cystic fibrosis, does not affect
	the power of linkage analyses. However, if different Mendelian
	genes are involved in disease in different families as in
	MODY, power can be reduced if all the families are analyzed
	together.</para>

	<para>For complex diseases, the involvement of many genes and
	the strong influence of environmental factors means that large
	multi-generation pedigrees are rarely, or never, seen. Linkage
	analysis of nuclear families with both parents and two
	children affected with the disease, although less powerful, is
	therefore more commonly used to map complex traits (Thomson
	and Esposito 1999, Thomson 1995a, 1995b, 2001a,
	2001b). Consider an affected sib pair family (<xref
	linkend="affected-sib-pair"/>), and assume for simplicity we
	can distinguish all four parental chromosomes in the genetic
	region under study. Deviation from the Mendelian random
	expectations of 25%, 50%, and 25%, that the affected sibs will
	on average share 2, 1, and 0 parental chromosomes in common
	that are identical by descent (ibd) implicates a disease
	predisposing gene in the region.</para>

         that A and C are transmitted from the father and mother
         respectively to the first affected child (Thomson 1995a and
         1995b). Four possible configurations among the two offspring
         with respect to the alleles inherited from the parents are
         possible: they can share both parental alleles (AC); they can
         share an allele from the father (A) but differ in the alleles
         received from the mother (C and D); they can share an allele
         from the mother (C) but differ in the alleles received from
         the father (A and B); or they can share no parental alleles
         in common. These four configurations are equally likely if
         there is no influence of the genetic region under
         consideration on the disease. The parental alleles that are
         never transmitted to the affected sib pair in each family
         type are used as a control population in association studies
         using nuclear family data, the so-called AFBAC (affected
         family based control) sample (Thomson 1995a, 1995b and see
         Section 4.2 below).</para>

	<title>Linkage studies in complex diseases</title>

	<para> Linkage of the HLA region to type 1 diabetes was
	demonstrated initially with 15 affected sib pairs (Cudworth
	and Woodrow 1975) (Table 1a). This linkage, termed IDDM1, has
	been confirmed in many studies (Table 1b), with a mean ibd
	sharing of parental alleles for HLA of 72% (Payami et
	al. 1985, Pugliese 1999, Mein et al. 1998, Concannon et
	al. 1998). For some other HLA associated diseases, e.g.,
	multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, the initial
	number of affected sib pairs required to show evidence of
	linkage has been larger, at least 50 and sometimes around
	100.</para>

	<para> Given the relative ease with which linkage was
	demonstrated for many HLA associated diseases, it seemed a
	logical progression to use genome-wide linkage scans on
	affected sib pair families to investigate all complex
	diseases. Such studies of many complex disorders are in
	progress: to map the non-HLA genes in a number of diseases
	such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid
	arthritis, celiac disease, and Crohn's disease; and for many
	other complex diseases, for example type 2 diabetes,
	hypertension, coronary artery disease, alcoholism, and
	schizophrenia.</para>

	<para>Type 1 diabetes was the first complex disease for which
	genome-wide linkage scans in affected sib pairs was carried
	out. Many other studies using genome-wide scans to detect
	non-HLA type 1 diabetes genes have followed since these papers
	(reviewed in Pugliese 1999). Apart from HLA, no evidence of
	major gene effects has been found. Using approximately 500
	affected sib pairs, linkages for the chromosomal regions IDDM4
	(11q13), IDDM5 (6q25), and IDDM8 (6q27) were confirmed (Luo et
	al. 1996) using the criteria of Lander and Kruglyak
	(1995). The mean ibd sharing values in these cases were much
	closer to the 50% expected randomly than seen with IDDM1:
	0.58, 0.58, and 0.60 respectively for IDDM4, IDDM5, and
	IDDM8. IDDM6 (18q12-21), IDDM10 (10p11-q11), and IDDM12 (2q33)
	have more recently been considered confirmed, using a
	combination of affected sib pair and association/linkage tests
	(see Pugliese 1999). Seven additional chromosomal regions have
	shown evidence of linkage to type 1 diabetes in one or more
	studies (reviewed in Pugliese 1999, Mein et al. 1998,
	Concannon et al. 1998).</para>

      <section>
	<title>Observations from genome-wide linkage scans in complex
	diseases</title>
	
	<para>A common feature of all complex disease studies has been
	difficulty in both detecting and replicating linkages, with
	considerable heterogeneity seen between data sets both within
	and between populations and ethnic groups. The possible
	involvement in disease of relatively common alleles of a large
	number of loci, each with a relatively small effect overall,
	requiring study of many hundreds, and usually thousands, of
	affected sib pairs to establish linkage, can explain this
	phenomenon (reviewed in Thomson 2001a, 2001b).</para>

	<para>Two recent second generation type 1 diabetes genome
	scans continue to illustrate the heterogeneity seen in linkage
	studies in complex diseases (Mein et al. 1998, Concannon et
	al. 1998). Even more surprising, little or no support was
	found for most reported type 1 diabetes loci in one of these
	studies (Concannon et al. 1998) even with a very large sample
	size. The use of stratification analyses based on known IDDM
	loci such as in the HLA region (IDDM1) may have contributed to
	more examples of evidence of IDDM loci in the second study
	(Mein et al. 1998).</para>

	<para> Despite initial anxieties with genome-wide linkage
	scans that we would be flooded with false positives (Lander
	and Krugylak 1995), this has not been the case. An excess of
	false linkages has never been a problem with complex
	diseases. Instead we are scrambling to find any evidence of
	disease-predisposing genes.In an insightful review of the many
	factors that need to be considered in the design of
	genome-wide scans and interpretation of linkage results, Rao
	(1998) pointed out that application of stringent criteria
	drastically reduces power, and leads to many disease genes
	remaining undetected. Rao's recommendation was that <quote>we
	tolerate/accept, on average, one false positive per individual
	scan.</quote> The issue is to have a reasonable balance
	between false positives and false negatives, while
	understanding that false negatives are the more serious
	concern.</para>

      <section>
	<title>Association (linkage disequilibrium) mapping</title>

	<section>
	  <title>Association analyses in case/control data</title>

	  <para> Association studies compare marker frequencies in
	  unrelated cases and controls, and test for the co-occurrence
	  of a marker and disease at the population level; a
	  significant association with disease may implicate a
	  candidate gene in the etiology of a disease. Alternatively,
	  an association can be due to linkage disequilibrium of a
	  marker allele(s) with the disease predisposing gene, and
	  this will usually imply close physical linkage of the marker
	  and disease predisposing gene (see section III.E above)
	  (Lander and Schork 1994), reflecting the historical origin
	  of a mutation on a specific chromosome with a characteristic
	  set of variation. In association studies it is essential
	  that the patient and control groups be ethnically
	  matched. If they are not, a spurious association of an
	  unlinked marker with disease can result from population
	  stratification, i.e., if there is a mixture of two groups in
	  the patient and control samples with different frequencies
	  of the marker allele and the disease. Given the large
	  variation in allele frequencies among populations (see
	  Section II above) even among populations from different
	  parts of Europe, precise matching of ancestry for the cases
	  and controls can be very difficult and historically many
	  false positives have been reported (Kidd 1993), Kang et
	  al. (1999) discuss one likely false positive for a complex
	  trait.</para>

	  <para>The success of association (linkage disequilibrium LD)
	  studies to fine map Mendelian traits following initial
	  localization of chromosomal regions by linkage analysis is
	  well documented in many different populations (Jorde et
	  al. 1994). In these studies linkage disequilibrium extended
	  on average over 500kb (0.5% recombination). There are
	  exceptions to the use of association data in localizing
	  disease genes; the breast cancer gene BRCA1 could not be
	  localized using linkage disequilibrium mapping as different
	  mutations were implicated in each family.</para>

	  <para>Association mapping may in many cases be more
	  efficient than linkage analyses in detecting genetic regions
	  involved in disease (Risch and Merikangas
	  1996). IDDM2&mdash;the minisatellite VNTR (variable number
	  of tandem repeats) 5' to the insulin gene, which is easily
	  detected by association, is difficult to detect by linkage
	  analysis (Spielman et al. 1989). The well established and
	  strong HLA association with multiple sclerosis is not picked
	  up in all genome linkage scans (Sawcer et al. 1997). As with
	  linkage studies, haplotype level analyses can be more
	  powerful than single locus analyses (<citation>Barcellos:etal:1997a</citation>, Valdes et al. 1999a).</para>

	  <para>At least 12,000 highly polymorphic, evenly spaced
	  markers, giving an average distance between markers of 0.25
	  cM (250 kb), is required for an initial disease genomic
	  association scan. Association scans are thus over an order
	  of magnitude higher than the 300 to 400 markers at 10 cM
	  typically used for linkage genome scans. The use of pooled
	  samples of DNA for the study of RFLP (see e g., <citation>Barcellos:etal:1997b</citation>), and SNP variation (Germer et al. 1999), as well
	  as the current development of DNA chip technology for the
	  study of SNPs, has opened the way for future routine and
	  extensive use of association mapping in the study of complex
	  diseases. Genome-wide association scans in complex diseases
	  are starting to be used, currently with DNA pooling and
	  microsatellites.</para>

	  <para>Many researchers feel that the number of false
	  positives that will result from genome-wide association
	  scans make them unmanageable. A preliminary discussion of
	  power and a multi-stage strategy to reduce false positives
	  in genome-wide association studies is outlined in <citation>Barcellos:etal:1997b</citation>. As with linkage studies
	  (Rao 1998), power should be high in an initial association
	  scan, to reduce missing associations (false negatives), and
	  sample sizes of 500 - 1,000 are recommended (
	  <citation>Barcellos et al. 1997b</citation>, Long and Langley
	  1999). Long and Langley (1999) have demonstrated that
	  greater power is achieved in association genome scans by
	  increasing the sample size than by increasing the number of
	  markers.Association mapping
	  is appropriate for monogenic and complex diseases, and may
	  always be preferable to linkage analyses for late onset
	  diseases where it is difficult to obtain nuclear families,
	  rare diseases for which multiplex pedigrees may not be
	  available, e.g., type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis in
	  China, and infectious diseases.</para>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <title>Association analyses in nuclear family based data</title>

	  <para>The use of nuclear family data in association studies
	  was initially developed to avoid possible ethnic mismatching
	  between patients and randomly ascertained controls. The
	  parental marker alleles not transmitted to an affected
	  child, or never transmitted to an affected sib pair, form
	  the so-called AFBAC population (Thomson 1995a, 1995b, 2001a)
	  (see Fig. 1). In a random mating population, when there is a
	  marker association with disease, the AFBAC population
	  provides an unbiased estimate of the overall population
	  (control) marker alleles when the recombination fraction
	  between the marker and disease genes is sufficiently small
	  that it can be taken as zero (&#xf071; = 0), and differences
	  between patient and AFBAC frequencies can be tested for
	  example by a contingency table analysis for
	  heterogeneity.</para>

	  <para>Of more importance, however, is the fact that concerns
	  about population stratification effects creating
	  associations between unlinked loci are completely removed
	  with family-based data. Testing for a 50% transmission ratio
	  from parents heterozygous for a marker allele (the
	  TDT&mdash;transmission disequilibrium test) detects
	  significant differences with marker alleles that are in both
	  linkage disequilibrium and linked to the disease
	  predisposing gene (Spielman et al. 1993, Martin et al. 1997,
	  Monks et al. 1998). This is because a compound null
	  hypothesis is always being tested which involves a term
	  which is zero if the marker and disease are unlinked, and a
	  term which is zero if there is no linkage disequilibrium at
	  the population level. Thus, associations at the population
	  level of unlinked marker loci with disease caused by
	  population stratification, migration or admixture, are
	  eliminated, and significant effects are only seen for marker
	  loci linked and in linkage disequilibrium with the disease
	  loci. Further, results across populations can be combined
	  using the TDT statistic, although it is important to keep in
	  mind that power could be reduced if the same association(s)
	  is not seen in all populations, association screens.</para>

	  <title>Association studies in complex diseases</title>

	  <para>Association mapping has been the main approach in
	  implicating genes of the HLA region in disease etiology
	  (Table 2). Association studies in the early 1970s
	  distinguished type 1 (HLA associated) from type 2 (not HLA
	  associated) diabetes. Association mapping has also been
	  involved in mapping non-HLA genes. In a small subset of type
	  2 diabetes cases association studies have identified the
	  role of candidate genes in disease, e.g., the insulin gene,
	  insulin receptor gene, glukokinase gene, and genes in the
	  mitochondrial genome (see Thomson (1997) for
	  references).</para>

	  <para>The potential of
	  association studies as the optimal strategy for follow-up of
	  regions showing preliminary evidence of linkage for complex
	  diseases has been demonstrated (Mein et al. 1998), and
	  awaits full utilization. As with linkage studies,
	  heterogeneity in association results for complex diseases is
	  also seen between studies, especially between populations,
	  and is expected (Mein et al. 1998, Long and Langley
	  1999). In their simulation study, Long and Langley (1999)
	  concluded that association studies have a low repeatability
	  unless sample sizes are on the order of 500
	  individuals.</para>

	  <para>Association mapping is appropriate for monogenic and
	  complex diseases, and may always be preferable to linkage
	  analyses for late onset diseases where it is difficult to
	  obtain nuclear families, rare diseases for which multiplex
	  pedigrees may not be available, e.g., type 1 diabetes and

	  design can incorporate disease heterogeneity and interaction
	  effects between loci.</para>

      <section>
	<title>Determining the genetic components involved in disease,
	the haplotype method</title>

	<para> Determining the precise HLA components of disease is
	difficult for the following primary reasons: multiple genetic
	factors are involved; the HLA genes are in strong linkage
	disequilibrium; HLA region loci have many polymorphic
	residues; common HLA alleles may be involved in disease; and
	interaction effects among HLA, and/or non-HLA, disease loci
	may be important. These characteristics make necessary a
	multi-strategy approach, in which complementary methods are
	used. These include analysis of data from various ethnically
	or geographically defined groups, as differences in HLA
	polymorphism and disease prevalence across groups can point
	toward the precise genetic factors that are important in
	disease. The methods which have been applied to HLA data to
	identify the actual disease predisposing factors, and to
	determine all disease factors in the region, and the
	difficulties encountered, apply equally to non-HLA
	regions.</para>

	<para>While linkage disequilibrium is our ally in detecting
	genetic regions involved in disease, it confounds attempts to
	identify the actual gene in the region involved in disease and
	to identify additional genes in the region contributing to
	disease. The so-called haplotype method to identify
	disease-predisposing alleles and amino acids in a genetic
	region is a stratification analysis to take account of the
	effects of linkage disequilibrium (Valdes et al. 1997, Valdes
	and Thomson 1997). If all alleles, or amino acid sites,
	directly involved in disease in a genetic region have been
	identified, then considering haplotypes (chromosome
	combinations) containing all these sites, the relative
	frequencies of alleles and amino acid sites on these
	haplotypes not involved in disease should be the same in
	patients and controls. The absolute frequencies of these
	haplotypes will differ between patients and controls, but the
	ratio of variants at sites not involved in disease will not
	differ between patients and controls, provided all alleles or
	amino acids involved in disease have been identified and all
	these sites are included in the haplotypes
	considered. Obviously, the haplotype method cannot distinguish
	between sites which are very highly correlated in a
	population, however ethnic comparisons can help identify the
	predisposing factors. The method however can unequivocally
	determine if all disease predisposing amino acid sites in
	linkage disequilibrium in a genetic region have
	<emphasis>not</emphasis> been identified. At the amino acid
	level, a combination of sites at the HLA class II loci DRB1,
	DQA1, and DQB1 was shown to be highly correlated with the
	DR-DQ contribution to type 1 diabetes and to correlate with
	disease incidence (Valdes et al. 1997). In the alcohol
	dehydrogenase gene cluster variants at two tightly linked
	genes (ADH1B and ADHIC) cause altered enzyme activities. The
	high activity alleles at both loci are very common in East
	Asian populations and appear to protect against alcoholism
	when tested individually. Osier et al. (2000) showed by this
	haplotype method that the variant at ADH1B was responsible for
	the protective effect while the variant at ADH1C showed the
	statistical association only because of linkage disequilibrium
	with the variant at ADH1B.</para>

	<title>The Future: Overview</title>

	<para>With completion of the HGP, the functional and
	positional cloning of Mendelian traits and diseases will
	become fairly routine (Gelehrter et al. 1998). For genetically
	complex human diseases and traits the HGP will not provide an
	immediate solution to their genetics, although the ability to
	identify candidate genes de novo and in a region identified by
	positional cloning will greatly reduce the time required to
	home in on the actual genes involved in complex
	diseases.</para>

	<para>A multi-strategy approach to the mapping of complex
	diseases and traits is still appropriate: no single method is
	sufficient or optimal (Thomson 2001a). Genome-wide linkage
	studies are now routine, although still expensive and time
	consuming. Despite extensive efforts by many groups, progress
	in the mapping of complex diseases has been exceedingly slow;
	only a few genes and some genetic regions involved in complex
	diseases have been identified. The general picture is one of
	difficulty in locating disease genes and replication of
	reported linkages.</para>

	<para>The practical application of association studies in
	Mendelian and complex diseases in fine-mapping of genetic
	regions identified by linkage analyses has been demonstrated
	for many, but not all, disease predisposing loci. Also, while
	association mapping can narrow down a genetic region
	implicated via a linkage study, complete sequencing of this
	region, which may be many Mb long, is still an arduous
	task. Genome-wide association studies are now feasible with
	pooled DNA samples and are starting to be used. As with
	linkage studies, the overall power of association genome scans
	to detect disease genes is unknown. Power for both linkage and
	association studies depends on a number of unknown parameters,
	will vary across the genome, and also between populations and
	ethnic groups.  The increasing availability of more markers
	across the genome, combined with multi-point analyses using
	closely linked markers will increase the power of linkage and
	association studies, including the follow-up of regions
	potentially involved in disease.</para>

	<para>Increasing technological advances in molecular biology,
	such as the development of SNPs combined with DNA chip
	technology, and biocomputing will allow screening and analysis
	of large sample sizes, with predicted future rates of data
	output which are astronomical. The full development of SNPs
	will eventually permit routine typing for variation in every
	human gene, and their regulatory regions, the ultimate
	association study.</para>
