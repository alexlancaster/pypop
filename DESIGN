Beginnings of a class library for parsing IHWG files.

- 'ParseFile' is a base class which has most of the common functionality
for reading files.

- 'ParseGenotype' is a subclass of 'ParseFile' that deals with files
that consist specifically of data with individual genotyped for one or
more loci.

- 'ParseAllelecount' is another subclass of 'ParseFile' that deals
with files consisting of allele counts across a whole population.

Both file formats are assumed to have a population header information
with, consisting of a line of column headers (population metadata)
followed by a line with the actual data, followed by the column
headers for the samples (sample metadata) followed by the sample data
itself (either individuals in the genotyped case, or alleles in the
allele count case).


**TODO**

- Implement ParseAllelecount.

- Rationalize naming conventions for metadata.

- much other guff..
