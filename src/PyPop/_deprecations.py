"""API changes
-----------

In PyPop 1.4.0, modules have been renamed to follow the lower-case
convention of `PEP8
<https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names>`_.  In
addition to lowercasing, some have further renaming to clarify their
purpose and follow standard conventions. Backwards-compatibile
bindings have been created that allow end-user Python scripts using
the PyPop API to continue to work with the old module names.  However
such use will raise a
:exc:`~PyPop.PyPopModuleRenameDeprecationWarning` (a custom
:exc:`DeprecationWarning`). In the following minor release, 1.5.0, the
warnings will become more visible :exc:`UserWarning`. These bindings
will be completely removed in the next major release.

Note:
  Command-line users of ``pypop`` will not be affected by these
  changes, which are completely internal, scripts will continue to
  work with no changes needed in any configuration files.

Below are the list of all API changes, including removals and any
other ongoing API deprecations, and notifications of upcoming
removals.
