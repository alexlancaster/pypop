r"""**PyPop is a framework for performing population genetics analyses**.

It was originally designed as an end-to-end pipeline that reads
configuration files and datasets and produces standardized
outputs. While the primary workflow is file-based, most internal
functionality is exposed as Python modules and classes.

.. important::

   PyPop is not yet fully optimized for use as a library in end-user
   programs via a programmatic interface. Much of this public API is
   aimed at developers who are working on PyPop itself.

It is possible, however, to drive PyPop programmatically via the
:mod:`PyPop.Main` module. In the example below, we instantiate a
:class:`PyPop.Main.Main` object with a configuration instance with the
default settings, one analysis enabled, and an input ``.pop`` file. We
first create the :class:`configparser.ConfigParser` instance (see
:ref:`configuration file section <guide-usage-configfile>` in the
*PyPop User Guide* for the description of the configuration options),
supply this to the :class:`Main` class to perform the analysis, then
get the name of output XML file, and pass it to the :class:`Meta` for
the final TSV output (see also the :ref:`PyPop API examples
<guide-usage-examples-api>` in the *PyPop User Guide* for a
step-by-step breakdown of use of the API).

.. testsetup::

   >>> import PyPop
   >>> PyPop.setup_logger(doctest_mode=True)

>>> from PyPop.Main import Main
>>> from configparser import ConfigParser
>>>
>>> config = ConfigParser()
>>> config.read_dict({
...     "ParseGenotypeFile": {"validSampleFields": "*a_1\n*a_2"},
...     "HardyWeinberg": {"lumpBelow": "5"}})
>>>
>>> pop_contents = '''a_1\ta_2
... 01:01\t02:01
... 02:10\t03:01:02'''
>>> with open("my.pop", "w") as f:
...     _ = f.write(pop_contents)
...
>>> application = Main(
...     config=config,
...     fileName="my.pop",
...     version="fake",
... )
LOG: no XSL file, skipping text output
LOG: Data file has no header data block
>>> outXML = application.getXmlOutPath()
>>> from PyPop.Meta import Meta
>>> _ = Meta (TSV_output=True, xml_files=[outXML])   # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
