**TODO**

2005-06-15:

- 'setup.py' has horrible hack necessitated by GCC 4.0 which sets the
  CCFLAG -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2, this changes the behavouir of fprintf()
  and it's interaction with SWIG, if it is taken to _FORTIFY_SOURCE=1,
  then problem goes away.  See more here on this GCC list posting:
  http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2004-09/msg02055.html

2003-03-03:

- 'allelecount.py': add 'HomozygosityEWSlatkinExact' to calculate 
  homozygosity. Suggested by Yingssu. (_yingssu_: 100%-COMPLETED 
  2003-03-05).  

2002-10-17:

- 'ParseFile': derive map order from the order of the loci from the
  config.ini variable 'validSampleFields' (i.e. use that variable to
  specify map order, and use this variable as the return value of
  getLocusKeys in ParseFile.py).  This would mean that order loci in
  the .pop files wouldn't matter for correct map order.  Then we would
  use that as the list of loci to loop through for all subsequent
  analyses.  (_alex_)

2001-12-13:

- 'Emhaplofreq' : when passing individuals data to C module, filter
  out all individuals with missing data at any loci.  (_alex_:
  100%-COMPLETED 2002-01-17).

2001-11-27:

- 'Emhaplofreq' : add names of loci and associated numerical labels to
  output.  (_alex_: 100%-COMPLETED 2002)

- 'Emhaplofreq' : remove allele frequency output. (_alex_: 100%-COMPLETED
  2001-12-19)

- 'Emhaplofreq' : check accuracy of chi-squared output in LD section.
  (_single_: SOLVED 2001-11-29) the individual chi-squared values
  reported are actually computede for 2x2 contingency tables involving
  the alleles of interest and the complementary classes.

- 'Emhaplofreq' : ask Rich if we should increase the number of
   permutations by one since the observed data's LR value does not
   contribute to the distribution.  (_single_)

2001-11-21:

- 'Emhaplofreq' : XML-ify Rich's program (_alex_: 100%-COMPLETED
  2002-05-11).

- 'Emhaplofreq' : Conceive in more detail, the final output to feed into
  XML-ification (_diogo_: 100%-COMPLETED 2002).
  
  - decide on hierarchy of output files/sections 

  - decide which input parameters are reported 

  - need p-value computation?

  - decide what currently hard-coded values in 'emhaplofreq.h' should
    be user-configurable via 'config.ini' 
  
- 'Emhaplofreq' : After XML-ification, start on XSL stylesheet to
  consolidate output: each pairwise locus/allele into single table
  (_alex_: 100%-COMPLETED 2002-09-01).

- 'HardyWeinberg' :  Decide on additional values within each cell (in
  addition to obsv/expct), each p-values (_diogo_)

- 'ParseFile' : Check that missing value stats that are currently
  reported are adequate and correct (_diogo_).

2001-11-19:

- 'Emhaplofreq' : Calculate all pairwise loci linkage disequilibrium
  values.  Allow estimation of haplotypes of specified (via
  'config.ini' file) subset of loci (_alex_: 100%-COMPLETED: 2001-12-04).

- 'ParseFile' : Rejig internal format to allow more intutitive data
  retrieval in both row (individual-oriented) and column (loci
  oriented) form (_alex_: FIRST-PASS-COMPLETED: 2001-12-04).

2001-09-28:

- Implement XML -> text conversion using XSLT 'text.xsl' stylesheet,
  so that text output is always generated from XML output.  This will
  be done using the 'xml.xslt' API (part of the
  "4Suite":http://www.4suite.org XML/ XSLT package) (_alex_:
  100%-COMPLETED 2001-12-19).

- Remove all ad-hoc text output, all text output will be derived from
  the XML output, all serialization code will be collapsed into one
  (_alex_: 100%-COMPLETED 2002-02-13).

2001-09-20:

- 'gthwe' : Remove extraneous information from output: table,
  #alleles, chunkinfo, stepinfo.  (_alex_: 100%-COMPLETED 2002) 

- Longer-term: rationalize and/or modernize code (_diogo_ / _alex_ /
  _single_).

2001-09-14:

- 'HardyWeinberg' : Output a lower-triangular matrix for all relevant
  values. (_mpn_ / _alex_: 80%-COMPLETED 2001-09-21, need to add more
  values to cells)

- Output information about missing data on a per-locus basis (i.e. any
  deviations from the total number of individuals in each input
  file).  (_alex_: 100%-COMPLETED 2001-12-04)

2001-09-13: 

- "getopt-ify" emphaplofreq so that all currently hardcoded parameters
  can be passed in via command-line options.  (_alex_: 100%-COMPLETED
  2001-12-04)

- Add parameters for Guo and Thompson into "config.ini".  (_alex_:
  100%-COMPLETED 2001-09-18)

- Make number of significant figures reported be a global parameter
  set in "config.ini" (e.g. "%.4f") (_alex_)

- Wrap 'emphaplofreq' with SWIG, so that it can be called directly as a
  Python object.  (_alex_: 100%-COMPLETED 2001-12-04)

- Wrap 'gthwe' with SWIG, so that it can be called directly as a
  Python object.  (_alex_: 100%-COMPLETED 2002-01-30 )

2001-07-31:

- Finish cleaning up 'HardyWeinberg'. (_alex_ / _mpn_)

- Implement a 'PopGenStats' module (?) Move some 'population-level'
  statistics into this module. (_alex_)

*longer-term*:

2001-09-13:

- Abstract the configurator?  [use reflection to construct objects, so
  that constructors don't have to be hard-coded.]  (_alex_)

2001-07-31:

- Rationalize naming conventions. (?)

- Implement 'ParseAlleleCountFile'. (_alex_ : 50%-COMPLETED 2002-03-05)

**NOTE**: When editing this 'README' file, it will help to adhere to
the "structured text
conventions":http://www.python.org/sigs/doc-sig/stext.html since
Happydoc uses this information to format output documentation
(including HTML) nicely.
