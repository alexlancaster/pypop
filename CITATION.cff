  PyPop for Population Genomics (PyPop) is a Python program for processing
  genotype and allele data and running population genetic analyses, including
  conformity to Hardy-Weinberg expectations; tests for balancing or directional
  selection; estimates of haplotype frequencies and measures and tests of
  significance for linkage disequilibrium (LD).&nbsp;Output of analyses are
  stored in XML format for maximum downstream flexibility. PyPop also has an
  internal facility for additionally aggregating the output XML and generating
  output tab-separated (TSV) files, as well as default plain text files for each
  population. Although it can be run on any kind of genotype data, it has
  additional support for analyzing population genotype with allelic nomenclature
  from the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region.
